-Several models out there allow you to suggest any menu item as an add-on, and you can display a coupon for
that item as well.
-we definitely want to try out the menu item add-on feature and the coupons, so we’ll need to figure out which tablet
package has those features. I think we also want to decrease our average table turn time by about 30 minutes, since delays in service have been a
source of customer frustration.
- we’ve noticed a growing amount of food waste. I think part of the reason for this is that we comp meals when customers send
food back. 
-I’m adding to the charter that we’re going to roll out the pilot in the bar, check on tablet packages
that include menu add-ons and coupons, and get some estimates on a goal of reducing food waste
- The host software tracks table usage and wait lists, while the point-of-sale or POS software manages prices, tracks orders, and generates
the check at the end of a meal. The tablet software should be compatible with our existing systems, but we’ll need to configure them properly to
make the integration as seamless as possible.
-We’d like to start the pilot at the beginning of quarter two, which gives us next quarter to get everything ready. If we can do it sooner,
that’s even better since we tend to be less busy in January and February.

-In terms of our company-wide goal of increasing our product mix, we should be trying to raise the average check total. As we discussed,
we could do this by encouraging customers to order more appetizers, 
+Gilly also suggested the idea of selling more specialty drinks.
-Alex has emphasized that if we’re going to reach our goal of decreasing table turn time, their kitchen staff might need more help to meet the
increased demand. Alex thinks we’ll be able to reallocate some of the payroll from our FOH (that stands for front of house": 
all the servers and hosts) budget to hire more cooks.
+ open up two part time line cook roles in the meantime?
+About payroll reallocation, I’m a little hesitant to add that to the charter. How do we know we won’t need to hire more servers or hosts?
Also, we don’t have a guarantee on tablet performance and whether or not profit increases will be stable. Until we have some data that can
accurately project revenue increases, we won’t know how much we’ll have available to hire more kitchen staff. 
-Thanks for sharing your thoughts. I feel pretty strongly that we should target increased average check value as a goal, even if the main way to
reach it will be selling more appetizers and specialty beverages. If you think it’s best to adjust this goal by location, I’m fine with that.
Our average check value is currently $65 across all locations and we’d like to raise that to at least $75.
=Thanks again for the clarifications here. I can talk to the rest of the team about the payroll issue and whether reducing wait times 
should be a separate goal. Then I’ll summarize the insights around decreased table turn time, average check goal, and appetizer/drink sales in the
project charter, and then distribute it to the project team for review.

Confirmed goals:
Cut food waste by 25%
Reduce table turn time by 30 minutes
Increase daily guest counts by 10%
-I’m proposing a 15% average increase overall, with the North location targeted for a 10% increase and the Downtown location targeted for a 
20% increase. That way, the goals stay relevant to the unique trends of each location while still supporting the larger company goal.

 I think the tablets will allow our servers to cover more tables at once. We can spend some of our savings on hiring more kitchen staff to meet higher demand
 Well, the kitchen is going to need more staff at some point. In addition to line cooks, we’ll definitely need more bussers and runners. 
 Since we’re aiming to pilot these in April, I think measuring them through the end of June
