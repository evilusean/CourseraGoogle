========================================================Week 1:
Goals of Operations:
Operations=is defined as the process of transforming raw materials into finished goods.
Inputs(raw materials, labor, macinery) into Outputs(Finished product)
4 Primary Goals:
1)Cost
2)Quality
3)Speed
4)Flexibility
What do you optimize?
Optimization=You need to define your objective; Minimize cost, Increase speed, acheive perfect quality, etc
change your parameters within constraints, change how you use machinery, change order of production, etc
Economies of scale=You make more, it'll be cheaper to produce each individual unit
Cheaper Product=More Customers=More Profit

Lean Operations:
Lean is a management philosophy that started at Toyota-The goal is to produce as much product given a set of resources
Kaizen = Continuous Improvement 
Muda=Elimination of waste(x7):
  Transport=Moving products that are not actually required to be moved to perform the processing
  Inventory=All components, work in process and finished product not being processed
  Motion=People or equipment moving or walking more tjam os required to perform the processing
  Waiting=waiting for the next production step
  Overproduction=Production ahead of demand
  OverProcessing=resulting from poor tool or product design creating activity
  Defects=the effort involved iin inspecting for and fixing defects
B!Lean Thinking-James P Womack Daniel T Jones
5 Central Lessons of Lean:
  1)Specify Value-from the customers perspective
  2)Map Value Stream-Look at supply chain, map out where that value is created
  3)Make Value Flow-Discontinue activity that do not add value, and accelerate those that do
  4)Pull Back from Customer-Rather than push/nudgeing a product onto a customer-wait for them to ask for the product
  5)Strive for Perfection-eliminate all defects

Theory of Constraints:
Another philosophy that seeks to remove constraints from the production system that enable you to produce the most with given resources
X3 measurment variables:
  1)Inventory-What you put in prod
  2)Throughput-What customers buy
  3)Operational Expense-Converting inventory into throughput
Eliminate as many constraints as possible to acheive highest throughput
X3 Classes of constraints:
  1)Machinery-How fast can machines go
  2)People-Skilled employees to operate machines
  3)Policies-hinder throughput
X5 Step Procedures removing constraints:
  1)Identify Constraint-What factor in production system is a constraint
  2)Elevate Constraint-Make that piece of your system work better
  3)Subordinate everything else-Sometimes you need to make other parts work worse to increase overall system
  4)Exploit Constraint-
  5)Eliminate Constraint-Maintain total output and prevent reverting back to old ways
Slow machines limit the entire system from producing more
Drum Buffer Rope System-A drum creates the speed for the entire factory should never be faster than the slowest machine
  Buffer=Place buffers in front of bottleneck machines to ensure they never run out of materials to produce
  Rope=Tie Rope around every worker to ensure they all produce at same speed(metaphorical rope)
B!The Goal-Goldratt Summary:

========================================================Week 2:
Lean Inventory:
Just in time Inventory System: Some get a delivery every day/Some car manufacturers get inventory every 2 hours keeping it at lowest possible level
Your Transportation system acts like a warehouse
Holding Cost=Capital Costs(what you could do if money wasn't held up in inventory)+Inventory Cost(Taxes+Insurance)+Store Space Cost(Equipment+
Labor)+Risk Costs(Out of style/break/expire)
Higher Holding Costs=Smaller Optimal Inventory Levels
Order Costs=Order Submission(Can use automation to generate automatic orders)+Order Received(unloading trucks+Storing goods)
Safety stock is for uncertainty-Remove fluctuation in demand and remove need for safety stock-
  Remove variation in lead times also removes need for safety sock

Kan Ban Inventory System:
In grocery stores-They get inventory every day-Every day customers are buying items-only the items that were used were purchased/delivered the 
  following day-Constant turnover but Low Inventory buildup
3 Different Bins:
  1st Bin)On production floor-ready to be used for making product
  2nd Bin)Sits in warehouse facility-ready to go
  3rd Bin)Sits at supplier location-ready to ship to us
  As soon as Bin 1 is empty-place an order to supplier and start working on Bin 2-Bin 3 Arrives before you empty Bin 2
  Continuous supply and just enough inventory
  Size Of Bin=Lead Time Demand=Demand you experience before average shipment time, 1 day lead time=1 day of bin supply
  Only replenish what you use

EoQ(Economic Order Quantity):
https://github.com/evilusean/CourseraGoogle/blob/main/Rutgers:%20Supply%20Chain%20Management/2Supply%20Chain%20Operations/Economic%20Order%20Quantity-Calculation.pdf
Economic Order Quantity Terms and Notation:
The Economic Order Quantity Calculation(Can Calculate in Google Sheets)
Please remember the following notation of the formulas:
TC = Total Cost of Ordering and Holding Inventory
Q = Order Quantity (how much we order each time)
D = Demand (how much we sell in a given period â€“ usually one year)
V = Value of the item (purchase cost or production cost)
O = Order Cost (on-time cost of placing and receiving an order)
C = Inventory Carrying Cost (expressed as a percentage of the value of the item)

Safety Stock Calculation:
https://github.com/evilusean/CourseraGoogle/blob/main/Rutgers:%20Supply%20Chain%20Management/2Supply%20Chain%20Operations/2The-Safety-Stock-Calculation.pdf
SS = safety stock
k = service factor (the number of standard deviations to cover for a given service level)
Sc = combined standard deviation of lead time and demand
t = average replenishment lead time
Sd = standard deviation of daily sales
d = average daily sales
St = standard deviation of replenishment cycle

KanBan:
Calculate Average Demand
Calculate Average Lead Time
Calculate Average Demand * Average Lead time


========================================================Week 3:
Six Sigma:
In 1970/80's Japanese manufacturing was outpacing American Manufacturing
Documentary'If Japan Can, why can't we?'
B! 'Quality is Free' - Phil Crosby
Other Notable Names: Edward Deming/Joseph Juran/Karo Ishikawa
An increase in quality=reduction in throwing out/replacing defective products='Free'/Cost Neutral
Total Quality Management(TQM): x4
  1)Quality is defined by the customers requirements
  2)Quality is part of the top managements responsibility-Top down
  3)Improve Quality through a systematic analysis of the product and work processes
  4)Quality Improvement is a continuous effort
ISO 9000(standards):Certifies to the outside world that you have acheived a minimum level of quality within production systems
Standard is evaluated by third parties that are objective
Required to have entire supply base be certified to gain certification
Six Sigma(Philosophy):
  Developed by Bill Smith 1986(Motorolla)
  Error free rate-Aim for six standard deviations(99.999966%) Error free rate=3.4 Defects for every million products
X5 Steps:
  1)Define the Problem
  2)Measure it
  3)Analyzing it
  4)Improving it
  5)Controlling the process

DMAIC(Define, Measure, Analyze, Improve, Control):
https://sixsigmastudyguide.com/dmaic/#:~:text=The%20Five%20DMAIC%20Stages&text=Define%3A%20Collate%20what%20we%20already,%2C%20test%2C%20and%20implement%20solutions.
  1)Define=Clearly state how this problem affects the customer/List and gather available resources/Build Team/Establish Timeline/Create Project Charter
    Project Charter=Background and goals+Scope+Milestones+Project Budget
  2)Measure=Establish Baseline performance of process, Identify performance indicators, develop a data collection plan, validate the data
  3)Analyze=find root Cause, Cause and effect diagram, Process/Subprocess Mapping, Regression Analysis, ANOVA, Chi Square(Data analysis)
  4)Improve=Identify feasible solutions for the identified root cause(s), perform cost-benefit analysis, test the solution, asses effectiveness
  5)Control=Develop Control Plan, Validate Solution, Implement plan, Cost/benefit analysis, Formal project closure

========================================================Week 4:
Lean + Six Sigma:
Uses Goals of Lean and standardized procedures of six sigma to create a unified view on how to improve processes in a company
5x S's (to find root cause):
  1)Sort=Remove all unneccesary items from your workplace-if you don't use it, you don't need it
  2)Set in order=Organize workspace/tools so you can retrieve them in the most efficient way possible
  3)Shine=Clean it
  4)Standarize=Make sure you maintain your new setup
  5)Sustain=Create a system that makes you do this process over and over(Draw the outlines of tools on back of a cabinet)
