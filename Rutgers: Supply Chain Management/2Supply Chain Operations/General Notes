========================================================Week 1
Goals of Operations:
Operations=is defined as the process of transforming raw materials into finished goods.
Inputs(raw materials, labor, macinery) into Outputs(Finished product)
4 Primary Goals:
1)Cost
2)Quality
3)Speed
4)Flexibility
What do you optimize?
Optimization=You need to define your objective; Minimize cost, Increase speed, acheive perfect quality, etc
change your parameters within constraints, change how you use machinery, change order of production, etc
Economies of scale=You make more, it'll be cheaper to produce each individual unit
Cheaper Product=More Customers=More Profit

Lean Operations:
Lean is a management philosophy that started at Toyota-The goal is to produce as much product given a set of resources
Kaizen = Continuous Improvement 
Muda=Elimination of waste(x7):
  Transport=Moving products that are not actually required to be moved to perform the processing
  Inventory=All components, work in process and finished product not being processed
  Motion=People or equipment moving or walking more tjam os required to perform the processing
  Waiting=waiting for the next production step
  Overproduction=Production ahead of demand
  OverProcessing=resulting from poor tool or product design creating activity
  Defects=the effort involved iin inspecting for and fixing defects
B!Lean Thinking-James P Womack Daniel T Jones
5 Central Lessons of Lean:
  1)Specify Value-from the customers perspective
  2)Map Value Stream-Look at supply chain, map out where that value is created
  3)Make Value Flow-Discontinue activity that do not add value, and accelerate those that do
  4)Pull Back from Customer-Rather than push/nudgeing a product onto a customer-wait for them to ask for the product
  5)Strive for Perfection-eliminate all defects
