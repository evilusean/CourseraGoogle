Economic Order Quantity Terms and Notation:
The Economic Order Quantity Calculation
Please remember the following notation of the formulas:

TC = Total Cost of Ordering and Holding Inventory
Q = Order Quantity (how much we order each time)
D = Demand (how much we sell in a given period â€“ usually one year)
V = Value of the item (purchase cost or production cost)
O = Order Cost (on-time cost of placing and receiving an order)
C = Inventory Carrying Cost (expressed as a percentage of the value of the item)

Total Cost= Sum of Order Receiving Cost + Order Holding Cost
Total Cost = Order Receiving Cost(Order Cost*Demand / Order Quantity) + Order Holding Cost(Value of Product*Carrying Cost%*Quantity Ordered / 2)
TC(Q) = OD/Q + VCQ / 2
