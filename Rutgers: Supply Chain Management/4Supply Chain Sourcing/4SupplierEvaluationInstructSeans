The goal of this assignment is to have you build a supplier evolution system that you can use in your personal or business life. The assignment will be made up of several parts. First, you will evaluate your current suppliers. Then, you will set up a supplier segmentation framework. Next, you will evaluate your relationships with the most important suppliers in each segment. Last, you will outline an action plan to streamline your purchases from your suppliers.

Start by listing the ten most frequent places you shop (personally or business). Can you estimate the approximate share of your purchases for each place?

Note: if you do not feel comfortable using real store names, you do not have to. Also, you can use percentages for the share.

What categories of suppliers make sense for your situation? What do you name the categories? How do you assign the categories (what are your two dimensions)? Which of the suppliers you previously mentioned go into which category?

Note: it is okay if you want to use the common Strategic, Bottleneck, Leverage, and Routine delineation here - but if you can improve on it, that would be even better. Remember, the two dimensions are Profit Impact and Supply Risk.

For each of the suppliers who you mentioned (and placed in a respective segment) evaluate your relationships with each of them. Specifically, focus on the unique value you receive from them and the unique value they receive from you (revenue enhancements, cost savings, innovation, flexibility, etc.). 

Outline an action plan to streamline your purchases from your suppliers.
