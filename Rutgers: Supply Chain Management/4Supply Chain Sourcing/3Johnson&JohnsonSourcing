Sourcing at Johnson & Johnson
Let's examine how Johnson & Johnson (J&J) views sourcing as part of their firm's strategy. I believe this is one of the better examples as they 
publish a lot of their policies regularly. On a side-note, this is a great feat of transparency!

So, here we go:

The Credo:
One of the key pieces guiding J&J is their credo. Among other things, they specifically mention that their "suppliers and distributors must have an
  opportunity to make a fair profit."

Citizenship and Sustainability Practices:
As they mention, their credo is what guides them and their practices is what makes the credo into reality. Specifically, they have three strategic
  pillars: people, places, and practices. Among those are a number driven by sourcing:

Supplier Diversity: 
"Johnson & Johnson is committed to working with small businesses and diverse suppliers that support our growth objectives by providing innovative 
  solutions to our commercial, supply chain and R&D efforts. Supplier diversity progress is reported to the Johnson & Johnson Executive Committee 
  on a regular basis." 

This shows that diversity is one of the critical missions that sourcing has to accomplish.

Procurement & Supplier Management: this area is made up of three principles.
 Supplier Management: "Taking responsibility for the environmental and social impacts of our products begins with product design and development,
  and then extends to the sourcing, manufacturing and delivery of our products to our customers." This shows how deeply embedded sourcing is in
  the whole product development process.

Supplier Standards: "Our commitment to human rights extends to our business partners around the world. Our Responsibility Standards for Suppliers
  outline compliance expectations for suppliers and external manufacturers." While not completely uncommon, the responsibility standards show the
  commitment to fairness and transparency.

 Procurement Practices: "Our Procurement Sustainability Initiative (PSI) provides a foundation to guide our procurement professionals in their
  purchasing decisions and gives them a framework to provide guidance to influence our suppliers." Take a look at how specific they are about 
  what they achieved.

Finally, a lot of information can be found in the Citizenship and Sustainability report.

 Now, it is your turn to either dig deeper into J&J or find another company and see how they view their sourcing practices in relation to the
  broader firm strategy.
