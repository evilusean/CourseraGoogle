The Outsourcing Dilemma
With the recent political developments, the topic of outsourcing was in the news a lot.  As with any topic, 
there are at least two sides to the argument.  While my goal is not to take a side here, I believe it is critical to be familiar and
understand as much of this debate. With that in mind, there are several stakeholders, each with slightly different objectives. 
To help you think about this, I would like to point out some of the objectives that might drive behaviors in this decision. 

Company Leadership:
Must act in the interest of the company's owners (in the case of publicly traded companies, this is the investors), in shot their job is to:
Maintain and increase profitability (increase revenue and reduce costs)
Maintain competitiveness in the marketplace (against other companies offering similar products and services)
Reduce risk
Implement the vision and mission of the company

Affected Employees:
Maintain their employment:
Keep their jobs secure
Resist any outsourcing

Not-affected Employees:
Maintain their employment:
Keep their jobs secure
If necessary, restrict Outsourcing to other parts of the company if necessary

Investors:
Invest in a company for profit and thus want to ensure:
Their investment is paying a return that is sizable and secure
The company remains competitive.

The Public at Large:
is interested in a healthy and vibrant local community.

Of course, these are not all of the different viewpoints. Now it is your turn to add to the above objectives!
