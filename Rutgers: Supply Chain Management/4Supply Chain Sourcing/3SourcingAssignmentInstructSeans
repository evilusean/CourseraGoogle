Assignment Topic:

You should use these guidelines to select your own company you would like to review:

It should be a well-documented publicly traded company.

There should be a good amount of information publicly available, including on their own website, news sites, and generally on the internet.

For example see the information that Johnson & Johnson publishes

Setup instructions:

Before you begin, you will need to collect all relevant information. For example, if I was analyzing J&J, I would look at the following:

J&J Credo
https://www.jnj.com/about-jnj/jnj-credo
J&J Procurement
https://www.jnj.com/partners
J&J Citizenship and Sustainability report
http://www.jnj.com/sites/default/files/pdf/cs/2015-JNJ-Citizenship-Sustainability-Report.pdf
J&J Policies and Statements
https://www.jnj.com/about-jnj/policies-and-statements
Guidelines for the assignment:

Follow these instructions to understand the required format of your assignment:

The assignment  consists of several parts:

 Describe the company (what, who, where, when, how)

How much is purchasing/procurement/supply management/strategic sourcing mentioned in the public documents?

What is the contribution of purchasing/procurement/supply management/strategic sourcing?

What initiatives did they announce with their strategic suppliers?

Note: if you use outside sources (and it is strongly suggested),  please reference them clearly.  Not only is it professional to do so,  but copying and pasting is wrong and will not only detract from  learning, but also weaken your argument.
