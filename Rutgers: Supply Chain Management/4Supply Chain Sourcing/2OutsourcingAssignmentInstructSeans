Assignment Topic:

You can easily find an outsourcing story by searching news stories (Search "outsourcing" for example at: https://news.google.com). While you can pick any topic you want, it would be beneficial if you pick one that represents an area you know something about.  For example, if you have a local story, or a story from the industry you work in, or something where you have additional information.

Setup instructions:

Before you begin, you will need to have all the information you want to use in an accessible place. In writing answers to the questions, you should provide links to stories you read to allow your peers to see where the information came from.

Guidelines for the assignment:

Follow these instructions to understand the required format of your assignment:

Why is the company outsourcing?

What is the reaction from the affected workers?
