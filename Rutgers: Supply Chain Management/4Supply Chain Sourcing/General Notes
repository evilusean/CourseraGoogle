==============================================================================================Week 1:
Purchasing:
Direct Materials(Inputs)+Indirect Materials(Overhead)+Capital Goods(Land, Factories, Machinery)
Services:60% of cost on purchasing
Manufacturing: 70% of cost on purchasing
5 Steps:
  Purchasing Components:
    -Processing purchase orders
    -Receiving and monitoring advance shipment notices
    -confirming receipt of goods
    -processing invoices
    -paying suppliers
x12 rights:
Right Material at the Right Quantity at the Right Quality from the Right Source at the Right Price 
Delivered at the Right Time to the Right Location with the Right Transportation at the Right Level of Service
Managed with the Right Contract and Right Length of Payment Terms

Procurement:
Procurement Department adds value that it centralizes all activities that revolve around suppliers and manages relationships
Manage cost through negotiations
Lower price through volume commitments
X3 risks:
  -maintain service levels
  -Force Majeure, Catastrophic Events, natural disasters
  -Supplier going out of business

Supply Management:

Kraljic Matrix:
https://hbr.org/1983/09/purchasing-must-become-supply-management
  -Classify: all purchased goods and services (Profit impact-vertical, supply risk-horizontal)
  -Analyze: the supply market
  -Determine: strategic supply position
  -Develop: materials, strategies, action plans
    Top Left: High Profit Impact, High Supply Risk=Strategic Suppliers
    Bottom Left: Low Profit Impact, High Supply Risk=BottleNeck Suppliers
    Top Right: High Profit Impact, Low Supply Risk=Leveraged Suppliers
    Bottom Right: Low Profit Impact, Low Supply Risk=Non Critical Suppliers
How to Manage Supplier Relationships:
Strategic Suppliers, work to implement great relationships with them, partnerships
BottleNeck Suppliers, manage the risk, multiple sources of supply
Leveraged Suppliers, attempt to get as much as you can out of them, with lowest cost=Best Price, Best Quality, Best Service
Non Critical Suppliers, Simplify supply process as much as possible, automate, streamline-don't waste resources on them

Strategic Sourcing:
For your strategic suppliers focus on win-win relationships, create value together

==============================================================================================Week 2:
Make Vs Buy:
Do you make everything that goes into your product or do you find a vendor?
What are the boundaries of your company?
What business are we in? Are we good at it?
What do the customers want?
Do we have a competitive advantage?
Could we better spend the resources elsewhere?
Everything that is core should stay in house, everything that is not core should be outsourced, if you are not good at making something-outsource

Insource:
What should we create inhouse because we have an advantage?
No company can survive unless they have at least one area that they are better than the competition in
The more we create in house the more value we add for consumers, profit
a process done inhouse will improve over time
your own costs might be less than what a supplier charges while making a profit, for them
Hiring experts/consultants, invest in process(better technology), merger situation=take the best parts of each company to improve processes
2 risks to insourcing:
  your insource process is inferior to an outsource process; Higher cost, lower quality, less flexibility, worse service
  Administratively an insource process is inefficient to manage, outsourcing is a simple contract=if they don't perform, new supplier
