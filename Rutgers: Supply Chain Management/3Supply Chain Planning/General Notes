====================================================================Week 1:
Sourcing, Operations, Logistics all depend on accurate prediction of demand(planning)
Matching Supply with Demand

Forecasting Demand:
Forecasting=The prediction(guess what demand will be), Estimation(guess what level it will be at),Projection(Carrying it into the future) of demand
Time Series=Relies on historical data, demand over time, demand recorded over equal size intervals of time(day/week/month/year)
  The goal is to build a forecasting model based on past demand into the future
  [    D(Demand)    ]  [       F      ]             F=Future Demand
  |--|--|--|--|--|--|--|--|--|--|--|--|-->
                    T(time)
Refine forecast based on new data, try to minimize error(loss),  
Time series are made of several different patterns:
  Baselevel demand=Starting Value
  Trends=Demand goes up over time or down over time
  Seasonality=A pattern that repeats every month/quarter/year
  Cycle=Longer than a year, works like seasonality
  Random(Noise)=Impossible to predict
A good forecast will try to resolve all the patterns without trying to forecast noise
The best forecast is not always the most complicated one, if you can have an equally good forecast that is simpler, it is better to use
Forecasting is Art+Science, takes alot of work to monitor many different models and picking the right one at the right time
