2)Identify the role that each leg of the journey plays (e.g. pick-up, line haul, delivery, etc.).
A)ROGERS MN -> ROGERS MN
A pickup truck went to collect the package
B)ROGERS MN -> HAGERSTOWN MD
The distance was less than 1,700 miles which would of been done by intermodal train transportation for most efficiency so-
It was probably done by a long haul truck but potentially by intermodal train or line haul trucking
C)HAGERSTOWN MD -> NORTH WALES PA
Likely done by an overnight flight service or overnight trucker
D)NORTH WALES PA -> VALLEY FORGE PA
Finished off with a delivery truck to its destination

3)Identify the mode of transportation that is likely used.
Read above

4)Explain the routing between origin and destination (e.g. how much of a straight line between origin and destination).
ROGERS MINNESOTA TO HAGERSTOWN MARYLAND
Driving distance	1,068 mi	1,718.67 km
It is a fairly straight shot with one major stopover in chicago

HAGERSTOWN MARYLAND to NORTH WALES PENNSYLVANIA
=180.6miles
Short distance with multiple branches to small towns in the periphery, 4 potential course changes in less than 200 miles

NORTH WALES PENNSYLVANIA to VALLEY FORGE PENNSYLVANIA
=15.6 Miles
extremely short distance, a maneuverable delivery truck would be of most use in this general area

5)Analyze the efficiency of the routing (e.g. why the company likely chose this routing).
Potentially Hagerstown was a central sorting hub and then sent out to another terminal and then sent to it's final destination after
reaching a collection station
6)Express any areas of difficulty.
I made alot of assumptions based on little to no data/information, seems excessive for a simple assignment. Used google judiciously.
7)Reflect on what you learned in this assignment.
When transporting goods there are essentialy three phases; the pickup phase, the main portion of the trip, and the final delivery. 
Some or all of these phases could require multiple stops at terminals or hubs, each using potentially different forms of logistics, 
while trying to maintain a balance between cost and speed.
