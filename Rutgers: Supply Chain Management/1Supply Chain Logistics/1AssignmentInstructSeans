Transportation Evaluation

The goal of this assignment is to help you review the different types of transportation in a format that most of you are familiar with. 
This assignment will also help you determine how companies make decisions regarding routing, mode of transportation, and timing.

Now it is your turn:

Select an Express Delivery firm that is active in the United States and explain how their transportation network is set up. In detail,
I would like you to take a look at one shipment and analyze how the transportation company managed the delivery of the product from origin to 
destination.
