Objectives, Summary, and Further Information about Air Carriers
Air Carriers

Lecture objectives:
Understand how air carriers operate
How air carriers compete
Look into the future of the industry

Lecture Summary:
Operations:
All-cargo airlines are operating similar to TL - you rent the entire plane.
Commercial airlines are able to carry smaller quantities as belly cargo - similar to LTL.
Parcel carriers are also using planes for small shipments - but they are often very expensive.

Rates:
The rates in air transportation are often a mystery to many. While the rate is quoted by weight, the actual rate charged corresponds to that weight-
if the package has a certain density. This is also known as the volumetric density. 
So what happens when it is not the 'right' density?
If it is less dense, then you get charged for the volume translated to the corresponding weight
If it is heavier then you pay for the actual weight

Competition:
Fuel costs: who can best manage the largest expense and hedge against future price increases
Who can manage the delays put on by security concerns. Technology is starting to help alleviate these issues.
