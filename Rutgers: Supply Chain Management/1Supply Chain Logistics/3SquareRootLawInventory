The Square Root Law
The Square Root Law 
It is nice rule of thumb for  estimating the changes in overall inventory as a result of changing the  number of warehouses.
These calculations are assuming that nothing else  changes.

X2 = (X1) * √ (n2/n1)

n1 = number of existing warehouses n2 = number of future warehouses X1 = existing inventory X2 = future inventory

Examples:
Example 1:
Current inventory is 10,000 units
2 facilities become to 3
Estimated future inventory = (10,000) * √ (3/2) = 10,000 * 1.225 = 12,500 units.

Example 2:
Current inventory = 20,000 units
1 facility becomes to 4 facilities
Estimated future inventory = (20,000) * √ (4/1) = 20,000 * 2 = 40,000 units.
