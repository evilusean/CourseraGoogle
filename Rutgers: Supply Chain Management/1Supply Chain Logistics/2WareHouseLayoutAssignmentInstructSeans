Warehousing Assignment

In the previous lecture you have seen a traditional warehouse layout. But if you have actually seen a real-life warehouse, chances are that it looked nothing like what I showed you. The layout of warehouses have specific purposes and different designs can achieve the same purpose.

Now it is your turn!

In this assignment, I will ask you to take the traditional design I showed you and change it - for the better. You have to maintain all the areas that I included, but are free to move them around as you wish.

You will be evaluated on several aspects of your design:

Did you submit a new warehouse design?

Did you include all required features of the warehouse?

Did you explain how your design improves on the traditional design we covered in the lecture?

Assignment Topic:

You will have to submit your own improved warehouse design starting with the example I showed you in the lecture. 

How to create your assignment:

Before you begin, you will need to decide how you create the plans. My suggestion is to use a graphical program such as Google slides (free), PowerPoint, Keynote, or Visio (if you are really serious). Or you can simply draw it on a sheet of paper and take a picture of it.

How to submit:

You will be required to submit your assignment using an image file (jpg or png format). Make sure to include all the parts of the warehouse I included in my example:


dock doors

case lot/ fast mover section

bulk storage/ slow mover section

flow rack/ broken cases section

conveyor belt

sorter

packaging station

staging area

at least two miscellaneous areas (such as equipment storage and maintenance, and/or assembly, etc.)

There is no need to include additional technology or features.
