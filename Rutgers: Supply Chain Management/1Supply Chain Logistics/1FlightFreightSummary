Objectives, Summary, and Further Information about Flying Freight
Flying Freight

Lecture Objectives:
What makes air freight attractive to shippers? 
Cost structure is majority fuel and equipment 
What kind of equipment is used? 

Lecture Summary:
Air Freight Service Characteristics:
When importance of speed outweighs cost, then air is attractive for freight!
Emergency shipments
Typical commodities include mail, communications products, racehorses, etc.

Speed of service considerations:
Speed, travel time advantage can be off-set by flight frequency and timing
Smaller communities have experienced reduced frequencies
In-direct routing due to hub and spoke networks

Cost Structure:
The industry operates at: high variable costs (70-90%), low fixed (10-30%)
Government support of highway structure(trucking to and from airport)
Terminals not too capital intensive

High variable costs (about 60% of total, but can be as high as 80%)
About 30% attributable to flight operations
About 12% for maintenance
About 17% for aircraft and traffic servicing

How to deal with fuel costs: 
Increases have major impact on operating costs
More fuel efficient aircraft and smaller planes on low-density routes

Types of Equipment:
We need different planes for different purposes. 
All cargo planes
Extra-large planes
Wide body
Narrow body
Belly cargo(commercial flights)
Existing airliners
Smaller loads â€“ maybe a few containers
