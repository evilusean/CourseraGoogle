Logistics Networks Best Practices
#1 Use the fewest number of warehouses that are close to the largest number of customers
Since each warehouse adds cost you should be careful about the number of warehouses you have. Depending on how the network is set up,
there are no good or bad numbers, but as the number of warehouses changes, other factors must adapt as well, such as which warehouse certain 
customers are serviced by changes, so does the amount of inventory held in each warehouse, and of course the transportation part of your network.

#2 Keep your miles-per-delivery (MPD) as low as possible
A good starting point is to look at each warehouse and calculate the MPD for all customers. Here are some good rules of thumb:
The farthest customer should not be more than 1,000 miles from the warehouse (if we assume that we seek a 2 day ground delivery).
The average MPD should be between 300 and 400 miles.

#3 Find a balance
It is most important that you pick the network that make sense for you. That means you will not overspend in any one area or make a critical mistake.
Conservative approaches with careful considerations of the specific requirements will usually lead to the best results.
