==========================================Week 1: 
Moving Freight:
Land/Motor:
Benefits of Shipping by truck:
1)Speed
2)Reliability-low chance of break down
3)Low damage to the products
4)Accessibility
Cost(roads) subsidized by govt vs libertarians 'muh roads'
Costs=Fuel/Wages/Maintenance/Equipment/User Charges
City Trucks(small) vs Line Haul(40ft most common/53') Vs Refrigerated Vs LiveStock Vs Tankers
Terminals Take products from one truck, sort them and put them on another truck(not storage warehouses)
1)Pickup/Delivery Terminal: City truck -> Line Haul Vehicle
2)Cross Docks Terminal: connect networks of transportation together
3)Relay Terminal: Switch out Cab/driver with new one, same trailer keeps going

Motor Carriers:
TruckLoad(TL)=Shipper rents out entire truck(s)
Less-Than-Truckload(LTL)=You own a share of that truck(s) shipment and pay by weight
Parcel Freight=Faster, more expensive, smaller shipments


Flight Freight:
Benefits of Air Freight:
1)Speed
2)Capacity
3)Accesibility-any destination
When [speed > cost], air wins
Cargo planes Vs Narrow Bodied Vs Commercial Airlines(belly cargo)

1:All Cargo(entire plane is cargo)
2:Commercial Airlines(Belly Cargo)
Quote done by weight, a certain density is required 1kg=6,000cc(cubic centremeters)
Largest Expense is fuel
Delays are also a concern


Train Freight:
Intermodal:Containers on trains+trucks(2 or more modes of transport)
Large distance done by rail then last portion done by truck
Rail is cheaper than trucking and flight

Express Delivery:
DHL, UPS, FedEx, are the three giants
done through local terminals and delivery vehicles

==========================================Week 2:
Warehouses:
Why?
Consolidate Raw Materials Supplies Vs Getting direct from Suppliers
1)Creates efficiency-In Transportation, Inventory(hold where needed), Production(resupply easily)
2)Risk Pooling
3)Service levels-higher than they would be
Consolidate plant output in warehouses before shipping to customers-more efficient than shipping direct to customers
Functions of Warehouses:
1.Movement(warehouses facilitate)
2.Storage
3.Information(about inventory-when coming in, going out, how much product)
Private(owned by company) Vs Public Warehouse(owned by third party logistics company, shared by multiple companies)
What makes a warehouse good?
1. Speed
2. Quality / Redundancy(multiple checks-make sure product is the right one)
3. Productivity
Forklift Certified vs Dollys Vs Carts
Racks + Shelves
Conveyers and Sorters
Assemble and Pack before shipping

How to accomplish?
1)Speed?
Shortest distances possible - internal(most popular products located close to shipping dock
  and external(warehouse located close to customers)
2)Quality? 
Redundancy built in to the process + Maintain as much throughput as possible

Unloading -> Put away and storage -> Picking -> Packing -> Staging and Loading
Entire process controlled by warehouse management system
