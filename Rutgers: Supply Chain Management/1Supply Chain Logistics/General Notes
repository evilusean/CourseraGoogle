==========================================Week 1: 
Moving Freight:
Land/Motor:
Benefits of Shipping by truck:
1)Speed
2)Reliability-low chance of break down
3)Low damage to the products
4)Accessibility
Cost(roads) subsidized by govt vs libertarians 'muh roads'
Costs=Fuel/Wages/Maintenance/Equipment/User Charges
City Trucks(small) vs Line Haul(40ft most common/53') Vs Refrigerated Vs LiveStock Vs Tankers
Terminals Take products from one truck, sort them and put them on another truck(not storage warehouses)
1)Pickup/Delivery Terminal: City truck -> Line Haul Vehicle
2)Cross Docks Terminal: connect networks of transportation together
3)Relay Terminal: Switch out Cab/driver with new one, same trailer keeps going

Motor Carriers:
TruckLoad(TL)=Shipper rents out entire truck(s)
Less-Than-Truckload(LTL)=You own a share of that truck(s) shipment and pay by weight
Parcel Freight=Faster, more expensive, smaller shipments


Flight Freight:
Benefits of Air Freight:
1)Speed
2)Capacity
3)Accesibility-any destination
When [speed > cost], air wins
Cargo planes Vs Narrow Bodied Vs Commercial Airlines(belly cargo)

1:All Cargo(entire plane is cargo)
2:Commercial Airlines(Belly Cargo)
Quote done by weight, a certain density is required 1kg=6,000cc(cubic centremeters)
Largest Expense is fuel
Delays are also a concern


Train Freight:
Intermodal:Containers on trains+trucks(2 or more modes of transport)
Large distance done by rail then last portion done by truck
Rail is cheaper than trucking and flight

Express Delivery:
DHL, UPS, FedEx, are the three giants
done through local terminals and delivery vehicles

==========================================Week 2:
Warehouses:
Why?
Consolidate Raw Materials Supplies Vs Getting direct from Suppliers
1)Creates efficiency-In Transportation, Inventory(hold where needed), Production(resupply easily)
2)Risk Pooling
3)Service levels-higher than they would be
Consolidate plant output in warehouses before shipping to customers-more efficient than shipping direct to customers
Functions of Warehouses:
1.Movement(warehouses facilitate)
2.Storage
3.Information(about inventory-when coming in, going out, how much product)
Private(owned by company) Vs Public Warehouse(owned by third party logistics company, shared by multiple companies)
What makes a warehouse good?
1. Speed
2. Quality / Redundancy(multiple checks-make sure product is the right one)
3. Productivity
Forklift Certified vs Dollys Vs Carts
Racks + Shelves
Conveyers and Sorters
Assemble and Pack before shipping

How to accomplish?
1)Speed?
Shortest distances possible - internal(most popular products located close to shipping dock
  and external(warehouse located close to customers)
2)Quality? 
Redundancy built in to the process + Maintain as much throughput as possible

Unloading -> Put away and storage -> Picking -> Packing -> Staging and Loading
Entire process controlled by warehouse management system


Inventory:
How Much?
Cycle Stock vs Safety Stock
Cycle Stock: Inventory that goes up and down during regular sales and replenishment
Safety Stock: held just in case something unanticipated happens(demand vs logistics-supply not received)
When to order Inventory?
s.Q. Method: 's'=reorder point(when are you going to reorder) 'Q'=Fixed quantity
s.S. Method: 'S'=Variable Quantity

==========================================Week 3:
Logistics Network Design:
Facilities:
How many and where?
When in fewer locations you need less inventory(safety stock can be spread)
More locations, each location needs their own safety stock, more inventory
Warehouse as close to customer as possible
you don't need to stock every item in every warehouse
transportation network as storage device(keep inventory on trucks)

Factors Influencing Logistics Networks:
Cost Vs Service
Better service = higher cost(generally)
Minimize cost for best service possible
Two major factors=Cost of money(interest rates), cost of fuel(cost of crude)
High interest rates=high cost of inventory(cash could be used otherwise)

Lead time=time from order submission to time of order received
You want low lead time variance, short as possible, avoid delays
Fill rate=percentage of orders shipped from inventory

Overall Goal of Logistics(7 R's):
Deliver the right product, at the right price, to the right customer, at the right place, at the right time, in the right quantity, in the right
condition
SKU=Stock Keeping Unit(A items sell most, B, C sell less, not as critically important)
A items need best fill rate and lower lead times
