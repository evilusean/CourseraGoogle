Software Packaging and File Archiving on Linux
Introduction
This lab focuses on installing and removing software in Linux, and working with zipped files. You'll be installing a text editor called Sublime Text, and extracting/un-extracting .tar files. You'll also use apt to install/uninstall programs.

Head's up: You'll experience a delay as the labs initially load (particularly for Windows labs). So, please wait a couple of minutes for the labs to load. The grade is calculated when the lab is complete, so be sure to hit "End Lab" when you're done!

You'll have 60 minutes to complete this lab.

Start the lab

Installing Sublime Text
First, use dpkg to install a text editor, called Sublime Text. A .deb file is located at "/home/qwiklab/downloads/sublime-text_build-3211_amd64.deb", which you can install using this command:

sudo dpkg -i /home/qwiklab/downloads/sublime-text_build-3211_amd64.deb
Copied!
You'll see some errors after this command, but that's okay! The Sublime Text package has some dependencies that aren't installed on your machine yet, and dpkg is just warning you that they need to be installed:

Selecting previously unselected package sublime-text.
(Reading database ... 36788 files and directories currently installed.)
Preparing to unpack .../sublime-text_build-3211_amd64.deb ...

dpkg: dependency problems prevent configuration of sublime-text:
 sublime-text depends on libgtk-3-0; however:
  Package libgtk-3-0 is not installed.
dpkg: error processing package sublime-text (--install):
 dependency problems - leaving unconfigured
Processing triggers for mime-support (3.62) ...
Processing triggers for hicolor-icon-theme (0.17-2) ...
Errors were encountered while processing:
 sublime-text
You can remedy this by using apt to fix the missing dependencies, using this command:

sudo apt install -f
Copied!
You'll be prompted to confirm your decision to continue with the operation by typing "Y" (for "Yes"), midway through the process.

Now Sublime Text is successfully installed, which you can verify using dpkg:

dpkg -s sublime-text
Copied!
Package: sublime-text

Install Sublime Text
Extracting an archive
Next, you will extract a .tar archive. The archive "extract_me.tar" is located in "/home/qwiklab/downloads/". Move to that directory, using this command:

cd /home/qwiklab/downloads
Copied!
You can use the Linux tar command to extract it using this command:

sudo tar -xvf extract_me.tar
Copied!
The contents of the archive (the file named "great_job") are then extracted:

home/qwiklab/extract_me/
home/qwiklab/extract_me/great_job
Click Check my progress to verify the objective.

Extract Archive
Archiving files
First, move back to the original directory:

cd ~
Copied!
You can also use the tar command to do the reverse operation, creating an archive. There are three files in your /home/qwiklab/documents folder named "Earth", "Mercury", and "Venus". Use tar to archive them into the file "Planets.tar" using this command (one line):

tar -cvf Planets.tar --absolute-names /home/qwiklab/documents/Earth /home/qwiklab/documents/Mercury /home/qwiklab/documents/Venus
Copied!
"Planets.tar" will then be added to your current directory, and will contain the three planet files:

/home/qwiklab/documents/Earth
/home/qwiklab/documents/Mercury
/home/qwiklab/documents/Venus
Click Check my progress to verify the objective.

Archive Files
Installing 7-Zip
You can also install programs on Linux, using apt too, which handles dependencies for you to simplify the installation process. You can install the program 7-Zip, using apt, with a simple one-line command:

sudo apt install p7zip-full
Copied!
When it's finished, 7-Zip will be installed:

Uninstalling GIMP
Uninstallation can also be handled by apt by using "remove" instead of "install" as the argument. GIMP, an image-editing program, is already installed on your machine. Uninstall it now, using apt with this command:

sudo apt remove gimp
Copied!
You'll be prompted to confirm your decision midway through the uninstallation process. Confirm this by typing "Y" (for "Yes"). Then, GIMP will be uninstalled:
