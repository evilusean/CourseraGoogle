====================================================================================Week 1:
Basic Commands:
GUI(Graphical User Interface)
CLI(Command Line Interpreter)= Command(cmd.exe)/PowerShell(powershell.exe) in Windows, 
  Shell/Bash= Linux Command Line is called a Shell and the language used to interact with it is Bash

List Directories(Paths):
Files and folders are organized in a hierachial directory tree, main directory that branches off paths
C:/ = Drive Letter, In Windows, File systems are assigned to drive letters(C:, X:, Y:). Each Drive Letter is a file System
  Each File System has a root directory which is the parent for every directory on that system
  C: Drive is default where Windows OS is installed
\ = Windows Subdirectories are seperated by '\' backslashes
/ = Linux Subdirectories are seperated by '/' Forwardslashes
Files can be hidden, such as config files, can be sean using the 'View' dropdown and checking 'Hidden items' box
  Can Change visibility in the right click 'Properties'
Properties=Name/FileType/Location/Size/Created, Modified, Accessed Dates/Attributes(Hidden/Read Only)/Security/Details/Previous Versions
Absolute Path=A path that starts from the main directory
Relative Path=A path that is from your current directory

=========================================================================Week 2:
Users and Groups:
2 Types of Users:
  Standard: One who is given access to a machine but has restricted access to do thimgs like install software or change certain settings
  Administrator: A user that has complete control over a machine
  Users are put together in groups according to levels of access and permissions to carry out certain tasks
Computer Management Tool(App search windows): Allows you to view users and groups
  -Task Scheduler:Allows you to schedule tasks and programs to run at certain times, like auto shutoff
  -Event Viewer:Where system stores system logs
  -Shared Folders:Shows folders that are shared between users
  -Local Users and Groups:Where you can perform group management
  -Performance:Shows monitoring for resources on machine like CPU and RAM
  -Device Manager:Where you manage devices like network cards, sound cards, monitors
  -Storage:Disk Management
  -Services and Applications:Shows programs and services you have available on computer
Windows Domain: a network of computers, users, files, etc that are added to a central database
  You can view users and computers from any machine in domain if administrator
User Properties:
  -User Must change password on next logon
  -User Can not change password
  -Password never expires
  -Account is disabled
  -Account is locked out
  -Member of: Can see what groups you are part of
UAC(User Access Control):A feature in windows that prevents unauthorized changes to a system
Guest Users: A Special type of user allowed to use the computer without a password, guest users are disabled by default
Authenticated Users: A group that does not include guest users

Passwords(Windows):
Computer Management -> Users/Groups -> UserName -> Right Click -> Properties or Set Password
Adding/Removing Users(Windows):
Computer Management -> Users/Groups -> Right Click -> New User 
Computer Management -> Users/Groups -> Right Click  User -> Delete
Mobile Users/Accounts:
Initial account you use during setup is called primary account, used to create a user profile
MDM(Mobile Device Management): Policies for security, how it is configured

File Permissions(Windows):
Right Click File/Directory -> Properties -> Security Tab -> Users/Groups + Permissions
Right Click File/Directory -> Properties -> Security Tab -> Edit File Permissions -> Add ->Type Name -> Verify
Only give access to certain files and directories to those who need it
ACL(Access Control Lists)=File and directory permissions are assigned using ACL's 
DACL(Discretionary Access Control Lists)=Who can use a file and what they are allowed to do with it
SACL(System Access Control List)=Used to tell Windows that it should use an event log to make a note of every time someone accesses a file/folder
Simple Permissions:
  -Read: lets you see that a file exists, and allows you to read its contents. It also lets you read the files and directories within it
  -Read and Execute: Let you read files and if the file is an executable, you can run it
  -List Folder Contents: Similar to read and execute(alias)
  -Write(W): Allows you to make changes to a file, you can have write permission without read permissions, allows you to create subdirectories
  -Modify(M): Umbrella permission that includes read, execute, and write
  -Full Control(F): Can do anything they want to the file, Allows you to take ownership of a file and change ACL's
Special Permissions:
https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc732880(v=ws.11).aspx
  -WD: Create Files/Write Data
  -AD: Create Folders/Append Data
  -S:Synchronize
  -(OI) — object inherit;
  -(CI) — container inherit;


File Permissions(Linux):
You can have 3 different permissions in Linux, rwx, you can also change numerically 421, add onto eachother 4+2+1=7(full access)
  use a 3 digit number to assign permissions 754=Owner(rwx, 7),Group(rx, 5),Other Users(4, r)
  -Read(4, r): Allows someone to read the contents of a file or folder
  -Write(2, w): Allows someone to write information to a file or folder
  -Execute(1, x): Allows someone to execute a program
Linux permissions are seperated into sets of 3; first trio refers to permission of owner of file/second trio=group permissions/third=all other user
  -Owner: u
  -Group: g
  -All other Users: o
ls -l ~/my_file #shows permissions on a file 
  -rwxrw-r-- #'-' bits are disabled: rwx(read write execute)=Owner permissions, rw-(read write)=Group permissions, r--(read)=All other users
's' SetUID(SetUserID) = special permission bit that is used to allow a file to be run as the owner of the file
 sudo chmod g+s <file> #SetGID(SetGroupID) special permission to allow it to to run as a group ID
't' stickybit = special permission Allows you to write to a file but not delete

=========================================================================Week 3:
Software Packages(Windows):
.exe(Windows Executable)=Contains instructions for a computer to execute when they're run
.msi(Microsoft install package)=Used to guide windows installer in the installation, maintenance and removal of programs from windows
Software Packages(Linux):
Linux Packages differ by distro
.rpm(Redhat package manager)
.deb(Debian/Ubuntu)
Mobile App Packages:
on most mobile OS, you can't just download executables, you need to go to a trusted centralized source(google play, app store) and download
only code 'signed' by the app developer of the app can be uploaded to the app store and after a security review
Enterprise app management=Allows an organization to distribute a custom mobile app, not available to general public, use enterprise certificate
MDM(Mobile Device Management): Allows enterprise app management
Side-Loading=Where you install mobile apps directly, without using an app store
Mobile apps are standalone sotware packages, so they contain all their dependancies
Mobile apps are cached, assigned a specific storage location for their data, resetting a mobile app to how it was when it was installed=
  clearing the cache will remove all changes to the settings, and sign out of any accounts that the app was signed into

Package Dependancies(Windows):
Dependancies=Counting on other pieces of software to make an application work, since one bit of code depends on another, in order to work
Dynamic Link Library(DLL)=A way to package a bunch of useful code that someone else wrote, can be shared with other programs vs DLL Hell
SxS(Side By Side Assemblies)=Shared Libraries are stored in 'C:\Windows\WinSxS' stores library manifests(old versions of libraries)

Package Dependancies(Linux):
Shared Libraries=Similar to windows DLL's, libararies of code that other programs can use
Package Managers=Come with the works to make package installation and removal easier, including installing package dependancies

Windows Archive:
Archive=Comprised of one or more files that is compressed into a single file
.tar .zip .rar vs 7zip

Linux Archive:
To extract a file using 7zip, use the command 7z and the flag 'e' for extract, and then the file you want to extract 

Windows Package Manager:
Package Manager=Makes sure that the process of software installation, removal, update and dependancies is easy and automatic as possible
Chocolatey=A third party package manager for windows, installs windows applications from the command line-Works with SCCM/Puppet

Linux Package Manager:
APT(Advanced Package Tool)=used to extend functionality of dpkg, finds packages to install, with dependancies, and cleans up packages you dont need
/etc/apt/sources.list =You can add package repositories to ubuntu here
PPA(Personal Package Archive)=software repository or uploading source packages to be built and published as an APT repository by launchpad

Windows Drivers/Devices:
Device Manager= Run: devmgmt.msc
  This PC -> Right Click -> Manage -> Device Manager , right click device -> Uninstal/Update/Properties/Scan For Devices
Drivers=Used to help hardware devices interact with the Operating System
Plug and Play=Automatically happens when you plug in a new device-recgonizes and installs appropriate drivers

Linux Drivers/Device Mgmt:
/dev = when a device is plugged into computer a file is created in the /dev directory
  /dev/sda /dev/sdb= mass storage device, sda detected first, sdb detected second, etc
'c' Character devices=Like a keyboard or mouse transmit data character by character
'b' Block devices=Like USB drives, hard drives, and CDROMS transfer blocks of data; a data block is just a unit of data storage
'null' devices=not all devices need to be physical
Kernel Module Vs sometimes kernel already has built in support for devices

Windows Updates:
search updates -> Windows Update Settings -> Advanced Options
To maintain security, you want to update frequently
Security Patch=Software meant to fix up a security hole
common practice to routinely update, process generally requires a restart
Windows Update Client Service runs in background to download and update 
You can disable windows updates

====================================================================================Week 4:
File Systems/Partitioning/Formatting(Windows):
File System=Used to keep track of files and file storage on a disk
  NTFS(Windows)/ext4(Linux)/FAT32(Mac Windows Linux)=4GB max filesize/32GB Max FileSystem
Partition=A storage disk can be broken down, a partition is a piece of the disk that you can manage
  You can have different File Systems(Linux+Windows) on different partitions on same physical disk
Partition Table=Tells the OS how the disk is partitioned
  MBR(Master Boot Record)Windows=Older Standard, 2TB Max Volume Size, 4 primary partitions max, with extended partitions
  GPT(GUID Partition Table)=2TB or greater volume size, one type partition, unlimited partitions
Windows Disk Management Utility=Used for partitioning disks/Formatting USBs
  This PC -> Right Click -> Manage -> Storage -> Disk Management Console
Diskpart(Windows)=Terminal based tool, used for managing disks/usbs from the command line
Mounting=Making something accessible to the computer, like a filesystem or harddisk

Formatting/Partitioning Disks(Linux):
Parted Tool(Linux)=Supports both MBR and GPT, x2 modes
  Interactive Mode(Parted):Launched into a new shell
  Command Line Mode(Parted):Run through commands in same shell
Use sudo mount to mount drive to a directory, sudo umount to unmount a drive
/etc/fstab #file that allows you to automatically mount files on system boot; contains unique device ID's, mount points, filesystems, +more
  UUID=Universal Unique ID

Swap Space(Windows):
Virtual Memory=How our OS provides the physical memory available in our computer (like RAM) to the applications that run on the computer
  Dedicates a portion of the harddrive for 'pages' of data, most frequently used data get's 'evicted' to ram for speed/ease of access
  Windows uses 'Memory Manager' for virtual memory management. Saved to 'pagefile.sys'on root. 
  Can change size, location, nuber of page files through 'System Properties'
  Control Panel -> System and Security -> System -> Advanced System Settings -> Advanced Tab -> Performance Settings -> Advanced Tab -> Virtual Mem

Windows Files:
File Data=Actual Contents of File
File Metadata=Everything else; size, location, owner, permissions, etc
MFT(Master File Table)=For Windows NTFS file systems, every file has at least one entry on MFT
  File Record Number=Index of files entry into MFT
  Shortcut's are just another file, entered into MFT
  Symbolic Links=Like shortcuts but at the filesystem level, an entry is created in MFT that points to another file
  Hard Link=An entry is added to the MFT that points to the linked file record number, you can change name of file and it still points to it

Linux Files:
inode=In linux metadata and data organized in an inode, stored in an inode table
Softlink=Like Symbolic link in Windows, point to another file, works like a shortcut
Hardlink=Like HardLinks in Windows, Links to an inode on an inode table, points to a physical location on disk

Disk Usage(Windows):
Computer Management Utility -> Disk Management -> Right click on partition -> properties -> General tab
  Can view used and available space on disk, 
  disk cleanup(cleanmgr.exe) can try to clean disk to free up space-deletes temp files, compresses rarely used files, empties recycle bin
  Disk Defragmentation=Take all files stored on a disk and reorganize them into neighboring locations, automatically done on a schedule
  start menu search -> disk defragmenter 
  Trim=For solid state disks to reclaim unused portions of the disk

FileSystem Repair(Windows):
Data Buffer=A region of RAM that's used to temporarily store data while it's being moved around
NTFS Log=Logs changes to metadata of files, creates a history of actions taken, can look at log to ensure data is consistent
Self-Healing=Automatically makes changes for data corruption problems
