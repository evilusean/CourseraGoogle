====================================================================================Week 1:
Basic Commands:
GUI(Graphical User Interface)
CLI(Command Line Interpreter)= Command(cmd.exe)/PowerShell(powershell.exe) in Windows, 
  Shell/Bash= Linux Command Line is called a Shell and the language used to interact with it is Bash

List Directories(Paths):
Files and folders are organized in a hierachial directory tree, main directory that branches off paths
C:/ = Drive Letter, In Windows, File systems are assigned to drive letters(C:, X:, Y:). Each Drive Letter is a file System
  Each File System has a root directory which is the parent for every directory on that system
  C: Drive is default where Windows OS is installed
\ = Windows Subdirectories are seperated by '\' backslashes
/ = Linux Subdirectories are seperated by '/' Forwardslashes
Files can be hidden, such as config files, can be sean using the 'View' dropdown and checking 'Hidden items' box
  Can Change visibility in the right click 'Properties'
Properties=Name/FileType/Location/Size/Created, Modified, Accessed Dates/Attributes(Hidden/Read Only)/Security/Details/Previous Versions
Absolute Path=A path that starts from the main directory
Relative Path=A path that is from your current directory

Listing Files Using CLI(Windows):
ls <path>
ls C:\ #Lists all files on C: drive root folder
ls C:\Users\Sean\Desktop #lists all files on desktop
ls -Force C:\ #shows all hidden files on C drive, aren't normally listed

Get-Help(Powershell windows):
Get-Help ls #shows a brief summary and all potential parameters of ls command
Get-Help ls -Full #shows more information and full description of parameters

Linux:
ls --help #Add --help flag to get more information on list command such as summary and potential flag parameters
man ls #Manual Command; used to show manual pages to get more information on list command such as summary and potential flag parameters

Listing Files(Bash/Linux):
ls / #lists all directorys under root directory
ls -l / #-l long flag, shows detailed information(dates/size/file permissions/owner/size) of files in the format of a long list
ls -a / #-a All flag, shows all files in a directory including hidden files
Important Directories in Linux:
  /bin #stores essential binaries/programs
  /etc #stores important system configuration files
  /home #personal directory for Users
  /proc #contains information about currently running processes
  /usr #For user installed software
  /var #stores system logs

Changing Directories(Windows Command '\'):
pwd #print working directory
cd #change directory
cd C:\Users\Sean\Documents #changes directory to absolute path of documents
cd.. #goes back/up a level in the directory tree
cd..\Desktop #will take you back to the folder \Sean\ from C:\Users\Sean\Documents to C:\Users\Sean\Desktop
cd ~ #takes you to the path of your home directory
cd ~ \Desktop #takes you to home directory and then to /Desktop directory in it
Tab Completion=Auto Completes the rest of a directory type 'D' press tab and it will go through all that start with 'D'

Creating Directories(Windows):
mkdir #make directory
mkdir New_Folder #makes a folder named 'New_Folder' in current working directory
mkdir New` Folder #windows command can not interpret spaces, use '`' backtick is an escape character in windows, or quotes 'New Folder'

Copying Files and Directories(Windows):
Ctrl + C #copy hotkey Ctrl + V #Paste hotkey
cp #copy command
cp mycoolfile.txt C:\Users\Sean\Desktop #copies mycoolfile.txt to the desktop, requires location as an argument to where it should copy to
cp *.jpg C:\Users\Sean\Desktop\ #copies all files that end with .jpg to desktop
  Wildcard=A character that's used to help select files based on a certain pattern '*' asterisk=anything in windows
cp 'Directory Name' C:\Users\Sean\Desktop\ -Recurse #-Recurse parameter allows you to copy all the contents in a directory
cp 'Directory Name' C:\Users\Sean\Desktop\ -Recurse -Verbose #-Verbose parameter prints a line for each item being copied

Command History(Windows):
history #shows a list of commands you have typed out recently
  You can scroll through recent commands by pressing 'Up' or 'Down' arrows on keyboard
Ctrl + R #history shortcut: shows recent commands used, start typing a part of recently used command for autofill
#tab completion #type '#' and part of the recently used command and then press 'Tab' to start cycling through matches
clear #clears output on screen

Changing Directories(Linux Bash same as Windows '/'):
pwd #print working directory
cd #change directory
cd C:/Home/Sean/Documents #changes directory to absolute path of documents
cd ../Documents #uses relative path to change to documents folder
cd ~ /Desktop #takes you to home directory and then to /Desktop directory in it
cd ../D <tab> #tab completion type 'D' press tab and it will print all that start with 'D'
Creating Directories(Linux):
mkdir #make directory
mkdir New_Folder #makes a folder named 'New_Folder' in current working directory
mkdir New/ Folder #linux command can not interpret spaces, use '/' forwardslash is an escape character in linux, or quotes 'New Folder'
Copying Files and Directories(Linux):
Ctrl + C #copy hotkey Ctrl + V #Paste hotkey

Copying Files and Directories(Linux):
Ctrl + C #copy hotkey Ctrl + V #Paste hotkey
cp #copy command
cp mycoolfile.txt ~/Desktop #copies mycoolfile.txt to the desktop, requires location as an argument to where it should copy to
cp *.jpg ~/Desktop #copies all files that end with .jpg to desktop
  Wildcard=A character that's used to help select files based on a certain pattern '*' asterisk=anything in windows
cp -r 'Directory Name' ~/Desktop #-r Recurse parameter allows you to copy all the contents in a directory
cp -r -v 'Directory Name' ~/Desktop #-v Verbose parameter prints a line for each item being copied

Command History(Linux):
history #shows a list of commands you have typed out recently
  You can scroll through recent commands by pressing 'Up' or 'Down' arrows on keyboard
Ctrl + R #history shortcut: shows recent commands used, start typing a part of recently used command for autofill
clear #clears output on screen

Moving/Renaming Files(Windows):
mv #move item command, allows you to rename a file
mv old_name.txt new_name.txt #renames old_name.txt to new_name.txt
mv name.txt C:\USers\Sean\Documents #moves name.txt to \Documents\
mv *.txt C:\Users\Sean\Documents #moves all .txt files to \Documents\

Moving/Renaming Files(Linux):
mv #move item command, allows you to rename a file
mv blue_document.txt ~/Documents #moves blue_document into documents folder
mv *_document.txt ~/Desktop #moves ALL _document.txt files to desktop

Removing Files and Directories(Windows):
rm #remove command, does not use recycle bin- gone forever, you can add permissions to files to prevent removing important files
rm ~\text1.txt #removes text1.txt forever
rm ~\important_system_file -Force #-Force parameter: use the force to remove files that require special permissions
rm ~\Misc_folder -Recurse #-Recurse parameter: to remove a file, you must do it recursively

Removing Files and Directories(Linux):
rm #remove command
rm text1.txt #removes text1.txt
rm -r misc_folder #-r Recursive flag: to remove a folder you must do it recursively
