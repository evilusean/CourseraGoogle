List Directories(Paths):
Files and folders are organized in a hierachial directory tree, main directory that branches off paths
C:/ = Drive Letter, In Windows, File systems are assigned to drive letters(C:, X:, Y:). Each Drive Letter is a file System
  Each File System has a root directory which is the parent for every directory on that system
  C: Drive is default where Windows OS is installed
\ = Windows Subdirectories are seperated by '\' backslashes
/ = Linux Subdirectories are seperated by '/' Forwardslashes
Files can be hidden, such as config files, can be sean using the 'View' dropdown and checking 'Hidden items' box
  Can Change visibility in the right click 'Properties'
Properties=Name/FileType/Location/Size/Created, Modified, Accessed Dates/Attributes(Hidden/Read Only)/Security/Details/Previous Versions
Absolute Path=A path that starts from the main directory
Relative Path=A path that is from your current directory

=========================================================================Week 2:
Users and Groups:
2 Types of Users:
  Standard: One who is given access to a machine but has restricted access to do thimgs like install software or change certain settings
  Administrator: A user that has complete control over a machine
  Users are put together in groups according to levels of access and permissions to carry out certain tasks
Computer Management Tool(App search windows): Allows you to view users and groups
  -Task Scheduler:Allows you to schedule tasks and programs to run at certain times, like auto shutoff
  -Event Viewer:Where system stores system logs
  -Shared Folders:Shows folders that are shared between users
  -Local Users and Groups:Where you can perform group management
  -Performance:Shows monitoring for resources on machine like CPU and RAM
  -Device Manager:Where you manage devices like network cards, sound cards, monitors
  -Storage:Disk Management
  -Services and Applications:Shows programs and services you have available on computer
Windows Domain: a network of computers, users, files, etc that are added to a central database
  You can view users and computers from any machine in domain if administrator
User Properties:
  -User Must change password on next logon
  -User Can not change password
  -Password never expires
  -Account is disabled
  -Account is locked out
  -Member of: Can see what groups you are part of
UAC(User Access Control):A feature in windows that prevents unauthorized changes to a system
Guest Users: A Special type of user allowed to use the computer without a password, guest users are disabled by default
Authenticated Users: A group that does not include guest users

Passwords(Windows):
Computer Management -> Users/Groups -> UserName -> Right Click -> Properties or Set Password
Adding/Removing Users(Windows):
Computer Management -> Users/Groups -> Right Click -> New User 
Computer Management -> Users/Groups -> Right Click  User -> Delete
Mobile Users/Accounts:
Initial account you use during setup is called primary account, used to create a user profile
MDM(Mobile Device Management): Policies for security, how it is configured

File Permissions(Windows):
Right Click File/Directory -> Properties -> Security Tab -> Users/Groups + Permissions
Right Click File/Directory -> Properties -> Security Tab -> Edit File Permissions -> Add ->Type Name -> Verify
Only give access to certain files and directories to those who need it
ACL(Access Control Lists)=File and directory permissions are assigned using ACL's 
DACL(Discretionary Access Control Lists)=Who can use a file and what they are allowed to do with it
SACL(System Access Control List)=Used to tell Windows that it should use an event log to make a note of every time someone accesses a file/folder
Simple Permissions:
  -Read: lets you see that a file exists, and allows you to read its contents. It also lets you read the files and directories within it
  -Read and Execute: Let you read files and if the file is an executable, you can run it
  -List Folder Contents: Similar to read and execute(alias)
  -Write(W): Allows you to make changes to a file, you can have write permission without read permissions, allows you to create subdirectories
  -Modify(M): Umbrella permission that includes read, execute, and write
  -Full Control(F): Can do anything they want to the file, Allows you to take ownership of a file and change ACL's
Special Permissions:
https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc732880(v=ws.11).aspx
  -WD: Create Files/Write Data
  -AD: Create Folders/Append Data
  -S:Synchronize
  -(OI) — object inherit;
  -(CI) — container inherit;


File Permissions(Linux):
You can have 3 different permissions in Linux, rwx, you can also change numerically 421, add onto eachother 4+2+1=7(full access)
  use a 3 digit number to assign permissions 754=Owner(rwx, 7),Group(rx, 5),Other Users(4, r)
  -Read(4, r): Allows someone to read the contents of a file or folder
  -Write(2, w): Allows someone to write information to a file or folder
  -Execute(1, x): Allows someone to execute a program
Linux permissions are seperated into sets of 3; first trio refers to permission of owner of file/second trio=group permissions/third=all other user
  -Owner: u
  -Group: g
  -All other Users: o
ls -l ~/my_file #shows permissions on a file 
  -rwxrw-r-- #'-' bits are disabled: rwx(read write execute)=Owner permissions, rw-(read write)=Group permissions, r--(read)=All other users
