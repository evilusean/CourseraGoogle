Creating, Modifying, and Removing File and Folder Permissions in Windows
Introduction
In this lab, you'll learn the foundations of how managing user permissions works on a Windows machine. Using the new Powershell commands you learned, you'll fix up the permissions of some files and folders.

Head's up: You'll experience a delay as the labs initially load (particularly for Windows labs). So, please wait a couple of minutes for the labs to load. The grade is calculated when the lab is complete, so be sure to hit "End Lab" when you're done!

What you'll do

In this lab, you'll create and change folder permissions using the Windows Command Line Interface (CLI), known as Powershell. In this exercise, you'll:

access administrative privileges to use Powershell in Windows.

view file and folder permissions using the GUI and Powershell commands.

modify the permissions for both files and directories by granting and removing specific permissions using ICACLS in Powershell.

modify the permissions for groups using the GUI and Powershell.

You'll have 60 minutes to complete this lab.
