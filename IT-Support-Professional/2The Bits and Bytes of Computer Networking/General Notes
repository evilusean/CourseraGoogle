TCP/IP Five Layer Network Model:
Bottom:
  1)Physical=Represents physical devices that interconnect computers(Cables, etc)
  2)Data Link Layer=Responsible for defining a common way of interpreting signals so network devices can communicate(Ethernet)
    Ethernet Standards also define a protocol responsible for getting data to nodes on the same network or link
  3)Network Layer(Internet Layer):Allows different networks to communicate with each other through devices known as routers
    Internetwork=A collection of networks connected together through routers, the most famous of these being the internet
      IP(Internet Protocol)=The heart of the internet and most smaller networks around the world
      Client Vs Server= Client initiates request, Server answers request and sends requested data
  4)Transport Layer=Sorts out which client and server programs are supposed to get that data
    TCP(Transmission Control Protocol)=Provides mechanisms to ensure data is reliably delivered to right machine/program
    UDP(User Datagram Protocol)
  5)Application Layer=Protocols that allow you to browse the web or send and receive emails

In addition to the five layer model we are working with, it’s important to note that other models exist. 
The traditional TCP/IP Model only has four layers, as it doesn’t differentiate between the physical layer and the data link layer,
but is otherwise very similar to the one we’ll be working with. The most well known other model is the OSI model.
It’s the model taught by many other networking certificate programs, like Net+ and Cisco’s many networking certifications.
The primary difference between our five layer model and the seven layer OSI model is that the OSI model abstracts the application layer into 
three layers total.

Networking Devices:
Cables=Copper vs Fiber
  Copper wires communicate by changing voltage representing a 1 or 0
    Types: Cat5, Cat5e, Cat6, Cat6a, Cat7 (cat=category, different physical charasteristics, all cables look same exterior, diferent speeds)
    CrossTalk=When an electrical Pulse on one wire is accidently detected on another wire
  Fiber=Contain invididual optical fibers, which are tiny tubes made out of glass about the width of a human hair-Transport light to rep 1 or 0
Hubs and Switches:
`Hub=Physical Layer 1(Physical) device that allows for connections from many computers at once
  'Talks' with all other devices connected to hub at same time, up to each machine to decide whether or not to ignore data
  Collision Domain=A network segment where only one device can communicate at a time, slows down entire network
  If Multiple systems try sending data at the same time, the electrical pulses sent accross the cable can interfere with one another
Network Switch=Similar to a hub with many devices communicating, except Layer 2(Data link) inspects contents, determines which system, sends it
  to the one system that requires it
Hubs and switches are the primary devices used to connect computers on a single network, usually referred to as a LAN(Local Area Network)
Routers=A Layer 3(Network)device that knows how to forward data between independant networks
  Can inspect IP data to determine where to send data
  Stores internal tables containing information on how to route traffic(generally to and from home -> ISP)
  BGP(Border Gateway Protocol)=Routers share data with each other via this protocol, which lets them learn about the most optimal paths to forward
  Home Network Router vs Core Router(ISP)=More advanced routers -Backbone of internet -handle much more traffic/complexity
Servers=Provides Data Vs Clients=Receive Data

The Physical Layer:
Consists of devices transmitting data(bits/packets)accross networks to server you are interacting with
Modulation=A way of varying the voltage of this charge(data sent) moving accross the cable known as Line Coding
Line Coding using Modulation capable of sending 10 billion bits(1 or 0) a second
Most common cable known as twisted pair(twisted pair of copper wire)
Standard Cat6 cable has 8 wires consisting of 4 twisted pairs in a single jacket
Duplex Communication=The concept that information can flow in both directions across the cable
Simplex Communication=The process is unidirectional
Full duplex=Both communications are communicating at once
Half Duplex=Although full duplex is possible only one device can be communicating at a time
RJ45(Register Jack45)=Most common ethernet cable plug
Network Ports/plugs have 2 small LED's; upper left side is link light LED and right side is Activity LED
  Link LED-switches on when cable properly connected to two devices that are both powered on
  Activity LED-Flashes when data is actively transmitted across the cable(old ports used to blink activity light directly with 1's and 0's
    being transmitted, Today it is much faster, too quick)
Ports connected to walls generally end at a patch panel ( [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] )
Patch panel=Device containing many network ports, container for ends of cables that then go to switches hubs routers or other devices
  
The Data Link Layer:
Ethernet and MAC Address:
Ethernet=Created in 1980, standardized 1983. 
  Ethernet solved the collision domain problem by using a technique known as carrier sense multiple access with collision detection
  CSMA/CD(Carrier Sense Multiple Access/Colision Detection)=used to determine when the communication channels are clear and when a device is free
    to submit data. If there is currently no data being transmitted on the network, a node will feel free to send data, when 2 or more computers
    are trying to send data at the same time-The computers detect this collision and stop sending data, rate a random interval and try to send agai
    Collision Domain=All devices on that segment receive all communication accross that entire segment, using a MAC address ensures it gets to 
      right node/computer
    MAC(Media Access Control) Address=A globally unique identifier attached to an individual network interface
      MAC Address=48Bit number normally represented by six groupings of two hexadecimel numbers
      Potential MAC addresses=2 to the 48th power=Trillion 281,474,976,710,656 Unique ID's
      OUI(Organizationally Unique Identifier) The first three octets of a MAC address-assigned to hardware manufacturers By
        IEEE(Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers)-You can ID any product manufacturer by first 3 octets in address
    Hexadecimal=A way to represent numbers using 16 digits (A=10, B=11, C=12, D=13, E=14, F=15)
    Octet=any number that can be represented by 8 bits
    Ethernet uses Mac Addresses to ensure that the data it sends has both an address for the machine that sent the transmission, 
      as well as the one the transmisssion was intended for
