TCP/IP Five Layer Network Model:
Bottom:
  1)Physical=Represents physical devices that interconnect computers(Cables, etc)
  2)Data Link Layer=Responsible for defining a common way of interpreting signals so network devices can communicate(Ethernet)
    Ethernet Standards also define a protocol responsible for getting data to nodes on the same network or link
  3)Network Layer(Internet Layer):Allows different networks to communicate with each other through devices known as routers
    Internetwork=A collection of networks connected together through routers, the most famous of these being the internet
      IP(Internet Protocol)=The heart of the internet and most smaller networks around the world
      Client Vs Server= Client initiates request, Server answers request and sends requested data
  4)Transport Layer=Sorts out which client and server programs are supposed to get that data
    TCP(Transmission Control Protocol)=Provides mechanisms to ensure data is reliably delivered to right machine/program
    UDP(User Datagram Protocol)
  5)Application Layer=Protocols that allow you to browse the web or send and receive emails

In addition to the five layer model we are working with, it’s important to note that other models exist. 
The traditional TCP/IP Model only has four layers, as it doesn’t differentiate between the physical layer and the data link layer,
but is otherwise very similar to the one we’ll be working with. The most well known other model is the OSI model.
It’s the model taught by many other networking certificate programs, like Net+ and Cisco’s many networking certifications.
The primary difference between our five layer model and the seven layer OSI model is that the OSI model abstracts the application layer into 
three layers total.
