TCP/IP Five Layer Network Model:
Bottom:
  1)Physical=Represents physical devices that interconnect computers(Cables, etc)
  2)Data Link Layer=Responsible for defining a common way of interpreting signals so network devices can communicate(Ethernet)
    Ethernet Standards also define a protocol responsible for getting data to nodes on the same network or link
  3)Network Layer(Internet Layer):Allows different networks to communicate with each other through devices known as routers
    Internetwork=A collection of networks connected together through routers, the most famous of these being the internet
      IP(Internet Protocol)=The heart of the internet and most smaller networks around the world
      Client Vs Server= Client initiates request, Server answers request and sends requested data
  4)Transport Layer=Sorts out which client and server programs are supposed to get that data
    TCP(Transmission Control Protocol)=Provides mechanisms to ensure data is reliably delivered to right machine/program
    UDP(User Datagram Protocol)
  5)Application Layer=Protocols that allow you to browse the web or send and receive emails
The reason they are layered is because you need the one before it to move on to they next layer

In addition to the five layer model we are working with, it’s important to note that other models exist. 
The traditional TCP/IP Model only has four layers, as it doesn’t differentiate between the physical layer and the data link layer,
but is otherwise very similar to the one we’ll be working with. The most well known other model is the OSI model.
It’s the model taught by many other networking certificate programs, like Net+ and Cisco’s many networking certifications.
The primary difference between our five layer model and the seven layer OSI model is that the OSI model abstracts the application layer into 
three layers total.

Networking Devices:
Cables=Copper vs Fiber
  Copper wires communicate by changing voltage representing a 1 or 0
    Types: Cat5, Cat5e, Cat6, Cat6a, Cat7 (cat=category, different physical charasteristics, all cables look same exterior, diferent speeds)
    CrossTalk=When an electrical Pulse on one wire is accidently detected on another wire
  Fiber=Contain invididual optical fibers, which are tiny tubes made out of glass about the width of a human hair-Transport light to rep 1 or 0
Hubs and Switches:
`Hub=Physical Layer 1(Physical) device that allows for connections from many computers at once
  'Talks' with all other devices connected to hub at same time, up to each machine to decide whether or not to ignore data
  Collision Domain=A network segment where only one device can communicate at a time, slows down entire network
  If Multiple systems try sending data at the same time, the electrical pulses sent accross the cable can interfere with one another
Network Switch=Similar to a hub with many devices communicating, except Layer 2(Data link) inspects contents, determines which system, sends it
  to the one system that requires it
Hubs and switches are the primary devices used to connect computers on a single network, usually referred to as a LAN(Local Area Network)
Routers=A Layer 3(Network)device that knows how to forward data between independant networks
  Can inspect IP data to determine where to send data
  Stores internal tables containing information on how to route traffic(generally to and from home -> ISP)
  BGP(Border Gateway Protocol)=Routers share data with each other via this protocol, which lets them learn about the most optimal paths to forward
  Home Network Router vs Core Router(ISP)=More advanced routers -Backbone of internet -handle much more traffic/complexity
Servers=Provides Data Vs Clients=Receive Data

The Physical Layer:
Consists of devices transmitting data(bits/packets)accross networks to server you are interacting with
Modulation=A way of varying the voltage of this charge(data sent) moving accross the cable known as Line Coding
Line Coding using Modulation capable of sending 10 billion bits(1 or 0) a second
Most common cable known as twisted pair(twisted pair of copper wire)
Standard Cat6 cable has 8 wires consisting of 4 twisted pairs in a single jacket
Duplex Communication=The concept that information can flow in both directions across the cable
Simplex Communication=The process is unidirectional
Full duplex=Both communications are communicating at once
Half Duplex=Although full duplex is possible only one device can be communicating at a time
RJ45(Register Jack45)=Most common ethernet cable plug
Network Ports/plugs have 2 small LED's; upper left side is link light LED and right side is Activity LED
  Link LED-switches on when cable properly connected to two devices that are both powered on
  Activity LED-Flashes when data is actively transmitted across the cable(old ports used to blink activity light directly with 1's and 0's
    being transmitted, Today it is much faster, too quick)
Ports connected to walls generally end at a patch panel ( [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] )
Patch panel=Device containing many network ports, container for ends of cables that then go to switches hubs routers or other devices
  
The Data Link Layer:
Ethernet and MAC Address:
Ethernet=Created in 1980, standardized 1983. 
  Ethernet solved the collision domain problem by using a technique known as carrier sense multiple access with collision detection
  CSMA/CD(Carrier Sense Multiple Access/Colision Detection)=used to determine when the communication channels are clear and when a device is free
    to submit data. If there is currently no data being transmitted on the network, a node will feel free to send data, when 2 or more computers
    are trying to send data at the same time-The computers detect this collision and stop sending data, rate a random interval and try to send agai
    Collision Domain=All devices on that segment receive all communication accross that entire segment, using a MAC address ensures it gets to 
      right node/computer
    MAC(Media Access Control) Address=A globally unique identifier attached to an individual network interface
      MAC Address=48Bit number normally represented by six groupings of two hexadecimel numbers
      Potential MAC addresses=2 to the 48th power=Trillion 281,474,976,710,656 Unique ID's
      OUI(Organizationally Unique Identifier) The first three octets of a MAC address-assigned to hardware manufacturers By
        IEEE(Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers)-You can ID any product manufacturer by first 3 octets in address
    Hexadecimal=A way to represent numbers using 16 digits (A=10, B=11, C=12, D=13, E=14, F=15)
    Octet=any number that can be represented by 8 bits
    Ethernet uses Mac Addresses to ensure that the data it sends has both an address for the machine that sent the transmission, 
      as well as the one the transmisssion was intended for

Unicast=A transmission is always meant for just one receiving address
  If the least significant bit in the first octet of a destination address is set to zero, it means the ethernet frame is intended for one address
  only-sent to all devices but only received and processed by intended destination
Multicast=Many receiving transmission
  If the least significant bit in the first octet of a destination address is set to ONE, it means your dealing with a multicast frame
  Sent to all devices, accepted or discarded by each device depending on criteria aside from MAC address (Accept lists)
Broadcast=All Devices
  Sent to every single device on a LAN, so they can 'learn' more about eachother
  Broadcast Address=FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF

Ethernet Frame:
Data Packet=An All-encompassing term that represents any single set of binary data being sent accross a network link
Ethernet Frame=A highly structured collection of information presented in a specific order(Ethernet Data Packet)
Each Ethernet Frame contains a fixed size data packet in a mandatory specific order, Contains:
  Preamble(8 bytes)=64 bits long, and can be split into 2 sections, first 7 bytes act as buffers as alternating 1's and 0's-Also syncs timer
  SFD(Start Frame Delimiter)(1 Byte)=Signals to a receiving device that the preamble is over and that the actual frame contents will follow
  Destination MAC Address(6 Bytes)=The Hardware address of the intended recipient
  Source Address(6 Bytes)=Where frame originated from
  VLan header(4 Bytes)=Indicates that the frame itself is a VLAN frame
    VLAN(Virtual LAN)= A technique that lets you have multiple logical LANs operating on the same physical equipment
  Ether-type(2 Bytes)=16 bits long, used to describe the protocol of the contents of the frame
  Payload(46-1,500 Bytes)=Actual data being transported
  FCS(Frame Check Sequence)(4 Bytes)=32 bit number that represents a checksum value for the entire frame
    This checksum value is calculated by performing a Cyclical Redundancy Check
    CRC(Cyclical Redundancy Check)=An important concept for data integrity, and is used all over computing, not just networks
      A mathematical Transformation that Uses polynomial division to create a number that represents a larger set of data
      Your CRC should match your checksum number to confirm you received uncorrupted data

=====================================================================Week 2:
The Network Layer:
IP (Internet Protocol):32 bit long numbers made up of 4 octets
  Dotted Decimal Notation
  IP Addresses are distributed to various organizations and companies
  IBM owns every single IP that has '9' as the first octet
  IP Addresses belong to the networks, not the devices attached to those networks
  Most common version of IP is IPv4(Internet Protocol version 4)
DHCP(Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol):How new devices connect to and receive their Dynamic IP address Vs Static IP(manually configured)
Packet(IP Datagram)=A highly structured series of fields that are strictly defined, 2 Parts=IP Datagram Header/Payload
ARP(Address Resolution Protocol)=A protocol used to discover the hardware address of a node with a certain IP address
ARP Table=A list of IP addresses and the MAC addresses associated with them
  ARP Table entries generally expire after a short amount of time to ensure changes in the network are accounted for

IP Datagram Header Contents:
  Version=4 bits=Indicates what version of Internet Protocol is being used
  Header Length=4 bits=Declares how long entire header is (IPv4=20 bytes almost always, 20 bytes minimum)
  Service Type=8  bits=Can be used to specify details about the QoS(Quality of Service) technologies
  Total length=16 bits=Indicates the total length of the IP datagram it is attached to
  Identification=16 bits=Used to group messages together
    (Maximum size of a single datagram is the largest number you can represent with 16 bits; 65,535)
    If the total amount of data that needs to be sent is larger then what can fit in a single datagram, the IP layer needs to split the data up
    into many individual packets
  Flags=5 bits=Used to indicate if a datagram is allowed to be fragmented, or to indicate if the datagram has already been fragmented
    Fragmentation=The Process of taking a single IP datagram and splitting it up into several smaller datagrams
  Fragment Offset=16 bits=
  TTL(Time to Live)=8 bits=Indicates how many router hops a datagram can traverse before it is thrown away
    Makes sure if there is an error and it creates an endless loop, it get's thrown away trying to reach destination
  Protocol=8 bits=Contains data about what transport layer protocol is being used (TCP vs UDP)
  Header Checksum=15 bits=A checksum of the contents of the entire IP Datagram header
  Source IP Address=32 bits=
  Destination IP Address=32 bits=
  Options=An optional field used to set special characteristics for datagrams primarily used for testing purposes
  Padding=series of zeros to ensure that header is the correct total size
Data Payload=TCP or UDP packet
Encapsulation=The Entire Process of creating header and payload

IP Address Class:
IP Addresses can be split into two sections: Network ID and Host ID
IP Address: 9.100.100.100
IP Address(in binary): 0000 1001.0110 0100.0110 0100.0110 0100
Network ID would be '9' in the above IP Address or first octet
Host ID would be 100.100.100 or second, third and first octet
Address Class System=A way of defining how the global UP address space is split up
Class A=First octet(Network), Last 3 Octets(Host ID)=2 to the 24th power potential ID's(16,770,216,000)
  Left most bit starts with a 0, Starting IP address can be 0.0.0.0 to 127.255.255.255
Class B=First Two Octets(Network), Last 2 Octets(Host ID)=2 to the 16th power
  Left most bit starts with 10, Starting IP address can be 128.0.0.0 to 191.255.255.255
Class C=First Three Octets(Network), Last Octet(Host)=2 to the 8th power=256 Potential ID's
  Left most bit starts with 110, Starting IP address can be 192.0.0.0 to 233.255.255.255
Class D=Left most bit starts with 1110, Starting IP address can be 244.0.0.0 to 239.255.255.255
Class E=Left most bit starts with 1111, Starting IP address can be 240.0.0.0 to 255.255.255.255
Class D and E are less important and used for multicasting(Sending Datagrams to networks all at once)
You can tell the class of an IP address by looking at the bits
CIDR(Classless Interdomain Routing)

Subnetting:
Subnetting=The process of taking a large network and splitting it up into many individual and smaller subnetworks, or subnets
Incorrect subnetting setups are a common problem you might run into as an IT support specialist, so it's important to hjave a strong understanding
Subnet Masks=32 Bit numbers that are normally written out as four octets in decimal
Subnet Mask=255.255.255.0
Subnet Mask(In Binary)=1111 1111.1111 1111.1111 1111.0000 0000
Subnet ID=Tells what to ignore when computing host ID (1's = ignore, 0's = what to keep)
Shorthand way of writing subnet masks=9.100.100.100/24 (means 24 1's followed by 8 0's in a 32 bit ID, 2^8=256 potential ID's)
Subnet mask=A way for a computer to use AND operators to determine if an IP address exists on the same network

Basic Binary Math:
Adding, Counting etc same as base 10(Decimal) as in base 2(Binary)
Binary                            Decimal
32   16   08    04    02    01  |  10    01
                             1  |         1
                       1     0  |         2
                       1     1  |         3
                 1     0     0  |         4
                 1     0     1  |         5
                 1     1     0  |         6
                 1     1     1  |         7
           1     0     0     0  |         8
           1     0     0     1  |         9
           1     0     1     0  |    1    0
           1     0     1     1  |    1    1 
Notice how the number before is double the latter number 1,2,4,8,16,32 right to left
If you have an 8 bit number=2^8(2 to the 8th power) potential numbers= 256 = 0-255
If you have an 4 bit number=2^4(2 to the 4th power) potential numbers= 16 = 0-15
you have an 16 bit number=2^16(2 to the 16th power) potential numbers= 65536 = 0-65535
Operators= + , - , / , * , OR, AND
1 Represents True, 0 represents False

CIDR:
CIDR(Classless InterDomain Routing)=More Flexible approach to describing blocks of IP addresses, uses subnet masks to demarcate networks
Demarcation Point=To describe where one network or system ends and another one begins
CIDR Notation=9.100.100.100/24

Routing:
Router=A network device that forwards traffic depending on the destination address of that traffic
Today most intensive routing issues are almost exclusively handled by the BIG ISP monopolies
Router sending data x4 steps:
Router Receives a Packet -> Router Examines destination IP -> Looks up IP destination network in routing table -> forwards traffic to destination
Routing Table=Has 4 columns
  Destination Network=Contains a row for each network that the router knows about, generally has a catchall entry that doesn't have explicit match
  Next Hop=IP address of the next network that should receive data, or states if network is directly connected
  Total Hops=Routers try to pick shortest possible path to destination-changes over time
  Interface=Has to know which interface it has to forward the traffic matching destination
Core Routers have millions of rows on their routing tables
Routing Protocols=special protocols routers use to 'speak' to eachother, 2 main categories:
  Interior Gateway Protocols=used by routers to share information with a single autonomous system. Are further split into two categories:
    Autonomous System=A collection of networks that all fall under the control of a single network operator
    Link state routing protocols=Determine the best path, each router advertises the state of the link of each of it's interfaces
    Distance-vector protocols=An older standard, a list of every network known to it and how far away in terms of hops, shares with neighboring 
    routers (Vector=List)
  Exterior Gateway Protocols=Used for the exchange of information between independant autonomous systems
    Used when different organizations need to share data. Interior used within same organization
IANA(Internet Assigned Numbers Authority)=Non profit organization that helps manage things like IP address allocation
  ASN(Autonomous System Number)=IANA is also responsible for allocation, numbers assigned to individual autonomous systems=32 bits

Non-Routable Address Space:
1996 IP Problem=IP address(32 bits)=Billion 4,294,967,295 Vs 7.5 Billion people=Not enough IP addresses for people on planet
1996 RFC(Request for Comments) 1918=Outlined for a number of networks(IP Addresses) to be non-network routable address space,
  allows for nodes to communicate with each other, but no gateway router will attempt to forward traffic to these networks
NAT(Network Address Translation)
3 ranges of IP addresses that will never be routed by core routers(belong to noone, anyone can use them):
  10.0.0.0/8
  172.16.0.0/12
  192.168.0.0/16

=====================================================================Week 3:
The Transport Layer:
Transport Layer=Allows traffic to be directed to specific network applications
Application Layer=Allows these applications to communicate in a way they understand
Multiplexing=Nodes on a network have the ability direct traffic to many different receiving services
DeMultiplexing=From the receiving end; taking traffic all aimed at same node and delivering it to the proper receiving service
Ports=A 16 bit number that's used to direct traffic to specific services running on a networked computer
Certain network services listen to specific ports for incoming requests
HTTP: Port:80
ports are denoted with a ':' after the IP address
Socket Address/Socket Number/Socket Port= 10.1.1.100:80
FTP(File Transfer Protocol)=Older method used for transferring files; Listens to Port:21 = 10.1.1.100:21
Ethernet Frame(payload) encapsulates a Datagram(payload) a datagram encapsulates a TCP segment
Ethernet Frame > Datagram > TCP Segment
TCP Segment=Made up of a TCP header and data section(Payload)
  Source Port=16Bits=A high numbered port chosen from a special section of ports known as ephemeral ports
  Destination Port=16Bits=The port of the service the traffic is intended for
  Sequence Number=32Bits=used to keep track of where in a sequence of TCP segments this one is expected to be
  Acknoledgement Number=32Bits=The number of the next expected segment
  Header Length=4Bits=communicates how long the TCP header for this segment is
  Empty=6Bits=
  Control Flagsx6=6Bits=
    URG(urgent)=A value of 1 here indicates that the segment is considered urgent and that the urgent pointer field has more data about this
    ACK(acknoledge)=A value of 1 here means acknoledgement number field should be examined
    PSH(push)=the transmitting device wants the receiving device to push currently-buffered data to the application on the receiving end ASAP
    RST(reset)=One of the sides in a TCP connection hasn't been able to properly recover from a series of missing or malformed segments
    SYN(synchronize)=Used when first establishing a TCP connection and makes sure the receiving end knows to examine the sequence field number
    FIN(finish)=When this flag is set to one, it means the transmitting computer doesn't have any more data to send and the connection can be close
  Window=16Bits=Specifies the range of sequence numbers that might be sent before an acknowledgement is required
  Checksum=16Bits=operates just like the checksum fields at the IP and ethernet level
  Urgent=16Bits=Used in conjunction with one of the TCP controls flags to point out particular segments that might be more important than others
  Options=0-16(if any)=Rarely used-used for complicated control protocols
  Padding=
  Data Payload=
Handshake=A way for two devices to ensure that they're speaking the same protocol and will be able to understand eachother
The three way handshake=Computer A first sends a TCP segment with SYN flagged (1), B sends a response with SYN/ACK flagged, A responds with ACK(1)
Four Way Handshake=How to close the connection= B -> A FIN, A -> B ACK, A -> B FIN, B -> A ACK

Socket States:
Socket=The instantiation of an end-point in a potential TCP connection
Instantiation=The actual implementation of something defined elsewhere, TCP sockets require an actual program to instantiate them
LISTEN=A TCP socket is ready and listening for incoming connections(server side only)
SYN_SENT=A synchornization request has been sent, but the connection hasn't been established yet(client side only)
SYN-RECEIVED=A socket previously in a LISTEN state has received a synchronization request and sent a SYN/ACK back(server side only)
ESTABLISHED=The TCP connection is in working order and both sides are free to send each other data
FIN_WAIT=A FIN has been sent, but the corresponding ACK from the other end hasn't been received yet
CLOSE_WAIT=The connection has been closed at the TCP layer, but that the application that opened the socket hasn't released its hold on the socket
CLOSED=The connection has been fully terminated and that no further communication is possible
There are other TCP socket states that exist, names can vary depending on OS, TCP is universal
Connection-oriented protocol=Establishes a connection, and uses this to ensure that all data has been properly transmitted
UDP(User Datagram Protocol)=like TCP but, Doesn't rely on connections, just set a destination port and send data

The Application Layer:
Payload=Generic Data section=The entire contents of whatever applications want to send to eachother
Many different protocols on the application layer, still standardized to application types
OSI(Open Systems Interconnection)Model=rigorously defined, introduces 2 additional layers inbetween transport and application layers
  Session Layer(facilitates communication between applications and transport layer)
  +Presentation layer(responsible for unencapsulated application layer can actually understand data; encryption/compression)

=====================================================================Week 4:
Name Resolution:
DNS(Domain Name System)=A global and highly distributed network service that resolves strings of letters into IP addresses for you
The Longer the Distance inbetween Server and client, the longer it takes to send data, DNS can automatically detect and send to closest webserver
Name Resolution=Turning a domain name into an IP address
x5 Primary types of DNS servers:
  1. Caching Name Server(ISP):Caching+Recursive DNS=purpose is to store known domain name lookups for a certain amount of time(TTL)
    TTL(Time to Live)=A value in seconds that can be configured by DN owner for how long a name server is allowed to cache an entry before discard
  2. Recursive Name Server(ISP):Perform full DNS resolution requests
  3. Root Name Server(13 total):Responsible for directing queries to the appropriate TLD name servers
    Anycast=A technique that's used to route traffic to different destinations depending on fators like location, congestion, or link health
  4. TLD(Top Level Domain) Name Server: Points to an authoritive server to contact
    TLD(Top Level Domain)=The last part of any domain name '.com' would be TLD in facebook.com
  5. Authoritative Name Server:Provides the actual IP for the server in question
Desktops/Phones/Laptops will generally hold their own temporary DNS caches as well
DNS uses UDP(User Datagram protocol=connectionless-doesn't need to connect/handshake like TCP)
Domains=Used to demarcate where control moves from a TLD name server(.com/.org/.net) to an authoritative name server(google/bing/microsoft)
Subdomain/Hostname='www.'
FQDN(Fully Qualified Domain Name)=Has Subdomain+Domain+Top Level Domain=www.google.com
DNS Zones=Allow for easier control over multiple levels of a domain
Zone Files=Simple configuration files that declare records for a particular zone
Reverse Lookup Zone Files=Let DNS resolvers ask for an IP and get the FQDN associated with it returned
SOA(Start of Authority) Record=Declares the zone and the name of the server that is authoritative for it
NS Records=Indicate other name servers that might also be responsible for this zone
PTR(Pointer Resource Record)=Resolves an IP to a name
Resource Record Types:
A Record=used to point a certain domain name at a certain IPv4 IP address
  DNS Round Robin=A Single Domain name can have multiple A records(IP addresses) and can split traffic between them
AAAA Quad-A Record=Similar to an A record but returns an IPv6 Record instead of IPv4
CNAME Record=Used to redirect traffic from one domain name to another; microsoft.com Vs www.microsoft.com
MX record=Mail Exchange-Makes sure email gets delivered to the correct server
SRV(service) Record=Used to find the location for various specific services
TXT(text) Record=Conveys additional Data+Configuration Preferences
