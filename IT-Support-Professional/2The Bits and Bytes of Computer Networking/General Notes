TCP/IP Five Layer Network Model:
Bottom:
  1)Physical=Represents physical devices that interconnect computers(Cables, etc)
  2)Data Link Layer=Responsible for defining a common way of interpreting signals so network devices can communicate(Ethernet)
    Ethernet Standards also define a protocol responsible for getting data to nodes on the same network or link
  3)Network Layer(Internet Layer):Allows different networks to communicate with each other through devices known as routers
    Internetwork=A collection of networks connected together through routers, the most famous of these being the internet
      IP(Internet Protocol)=The heart of the internet and most smaller networks around the world
      Client Vs Server= Client initiates request, Server answers request and sends requested data
  4)Transport Layer=Sorts out which client and server programs are supposed to get that data
    TCP(Transmission Control Protocol)=Provides mechanisms to ensure data is reliably delivered to right machine/program
    UDP(User Datagram Protocol)
  5)Application Layer=Protocols that allow you to browse the web or send and receive emails

In addition to the five layer model we are working with, it’s important to note that other models exist. 
The traditional TCP/IP Model only has four layers, as it doesn’t differentiate between the physical layer and the data link layer,
but is otherwise very similar to the one we’ll be working with. The most well known other model is the OSI model.
It’s the model taught by many other networking certificate programs, like Net+ and Cisco’s many networking certifications.
The primary difference between our five layer model and the seven layer OSI model is that the OSI model abstracts the application layer into 
three layers total.

Networking Devices:
Cables=Copper vs Fiber
  Copper wires communicate by changing voltage representing a 1 or 0
    Types: Cat5, Cat5e, Cat6, Cat6a, Cat7 (cat=category, different physical charasteristics, all cables look same exterior, diferent speeds)
    CrossTalk=When an electrical Pulse on one wire is accidently detected on another wire
  Fiber=Contain invididual optical fibers, which are tiny tubes made out of glass about the width of a human hair-Transport light to rep 1 or 0
Hubs and Switches:
`Hub=Physical Layer 1(Physical) device that allows for connections from many computers at once
  'Talks' with all other devices connected to hub at same time, up to each machine to decide whether or not to ignore data
  Collision Domain=A network segment where only one device can communicate at a time, slows down entire network
  If Multiple systems try sending data at the same time, the electrical pulses sent accross the cable can interfere with one another
Network Switch=Similar to a hub with many devices communicating, except Layer 2(Data link) inspects contents, determines which system, sends it
  to the one system that requires it
Hubs and switches are the primary devices used to connect computers on a single network, usually referred to as a LAN(Local Area Network)
Routers=A Layer 3(Network)device that knows how to forward data between independant networks
  Can inspect IP data to determine where to send data
  Stores internal tables containing information on how to route traffic(generally to and from home -> ISP)
  BGP(Border Gateway Protocol)=Routers share data with each other via this protocol, which lets them learn about the most optimal paths to forward
  Home Network Router vs Core Router(ISP)=More advanced routers -Backbone of internet -handle much more traffic/complexity
Servers=Provides Data Vs Clients=Receive Data
