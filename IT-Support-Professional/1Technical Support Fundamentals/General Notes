============================================Week 1:
Introduction to IT:
Information Technology(IT)=The use of digital technology, like computers and the internet, to store and process data into useful information
What does IT do?
Managing, Installing, Maintaining, Troubleshooting, Configuring computing equipment
Abacus-Invented 500bc earliest computers
Mechanical Calculator-17th century Blaise Pascal (gears+lever to perform addition subtraction multiplication and division)
Loom textile industry design patterns=programmable loom=1800's Joseph Jacquard=Jacquard Machine=Punch Cards
Charles Babbage=Difference Engine 1820's vs Analytical Engine+punch cards(+Ada Lovelace)First general purpose computing machine
Algorithim=A series of steps that solve specific problems

Encryption:
Cryptography=The art of writing and solving codes
Alan Turing=Enigma Machine Decrypted
Data was stored on punch cards until Magnetic Tape(Vinyl Records/Cassettes)
Admiral Gracehopper, Harvard="Bug in the system" Moth in a vacuum tube(Sept 9, 1947)
Admiral Gracehopper created first compiler(human language -> machine code)
Vacuum Tubes vs Transistors -> Hard disk drives/Microprocessors
Xerox Alto(1973)=First Computer with GUI+Mouse+Keyboard that resembled our PC's
Steve Wozniak+Steve Jobs=Apple1(1976), Apple2(1977)=First Consumer Produced PC(size+affordibility)
IBM 1981=MSDOS(Microsoft Disk Operating System)
Bill Gates=Windows(1985), Windows 95 for Household PC's
Atari Pong 1972=First 'Video Game' Vs Arcades
Atari Video Computer System=First Household videogame console
Richard Stallmen=First Free OS(GNU) Open Source
Ken Thompson/Dennis Richey=Unix
Linus Torvald=Linux
PDA's(Personal Digital Assistant)=First 'pocketable' computer(Nokia 90's)

Light bulb example 0=off, 1=on
A bit is a binary digit-0 or 1
A byte is 8 bits, 2 to the 8th power-256 possible outcomes
8 bits per character

Character Encoding=Assigns binary values to characters, so that we can read them as mere humans
ASCII=127 Values originally
UTF-8
RGB=colors
Logic Gates=Allow our transistors to do more complex tasks, like decide where to send electrical signals depending on logical conditions

Binary form Addition=128 + 64 + 32 + 16 + 8 + 4 + 1=Adds up to character through addition if switch is on
Vs Decimal Form

============================================Week 2:
HardWare:
Ports=Connection points that we can connect devices to that extend the functionality of our computer
Central Processing Unit(CPU)=the 'brain' of the computer, does all the calculations and data processing
Random Access Memory(RAM)=Short term memory
Hard Drive=holds all data
Motherboard=Holds and connects all computer components in place, circulatory system of the computer
Power Supply Unit(PSU)=Converts power from wall outlet into usable type by computer
External Data Bus(EDB)=Row of wires that interconnect wires of computer when voltage is on state is 1, no voltage is 0, veins of PC
Register=Inside CPU, allows it to store data
Memory Controller Chip(MCC)=Bridge between CPU and RAM, brain nerves of PC
Address Bus=Connects CPU to MCC, sends location of data to CPU, then sends data through EDB
Cache=Smaller than ram, stores data, faster than RAM, used to store frequently used data
  3 types of caches=L1 L2 L3 (L1 is smallest, fastest cache)
Clock Wire=CPU internal clock, keeps operations in sync, one clock cycle is a set of instructions
Clock Speed= Maximum amount of clock cycles that can happen in a certain time period(3.4GHz(gigahertz)=3.4 billion cycles per second)
Overclocking increases rate of CPU
