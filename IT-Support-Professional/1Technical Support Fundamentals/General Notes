============================================Week 1:
Introduction to IT:
Information Technology(IT)=The use of digital technology, like computers and the internet, to store and process data into useful information
What does IT do?
Managing, Installing, Maintaining, Troubleshooting, Configuring computing equipment
Abacus-Invented 500bc earliest computers
Mechanical Calculator-17th century Blaise Pascal (gears+lever to perform addition subtraction multiplication and division)
Loom textile industry design patterns=programmable loom=1800's Joseph Jacquard=Jacquard Machine=Punch Cards
Charles Babbage=Difference Engine 1820's vs Analytical Engine+punch cards(+Ada Lovelace)First general purpose computing machine
Algorithim=A series of steps that solve specific problems

Encryption:
Cryptography=The art of writing and solving codes
Alan Turing=Enigma Machine Decrypted
Data was stored on punch cards until Magnetic Tape(Vinyl Records/Cassettes)
Admiral Gracehopper, Harvard="Bug in the system" Moth in a vacuum tube(Sept 9, 1947)
Admiral Gracehopper created first compiler(human language -> machine code)
Vacuum Tubes vs Transistors -> Hard disk drives/Microprocessors
Xerox Alto(1973)=First Computer with GUI+Mouse+Keyboard that resembled our PC's
Steve Wozniak+Steve Jobs=Apple1(1976), Apple2(1977)=First Consumer Produced PC(size+affordibility)
IBM 1981=MSDOS(Microsoft Disk Operating System)
Bill Gates=Windows(1985), Windows 95 for Household PC's
Atari Pong 1972=First 'Video Game' Vs Arcades
Atari Video Computer System=First Household videogame console
Richard Stallmen=First Free OS(GNU) Open Source
Ken Thompson/Dennis Richey=Unix
Linus Torvald=Linux
PDA's(Personal Digital Assistant)=First 'pocketable' computer(Nokia 90's)

Light bulb example 0=off, 1=on
A bit is a binary digit-0 or 1
A byte is 8 bits, 2 to the 8th power-256 possible outcomes
8 bits per character

Character Encoding=Assigns binary values to characters, so that we can read them as mere humans
ASCII=127 Values originally
UTF-8
RGB=colors
Logic Gates=Allow our transistors to do more complex tasks, like decide where to send electrical signals depending on logical conditions

Binary form Addition=128 + 64 + 32 + 16 + 8 + 4 + 1=Adds up to character through addition if switch is on
Vs Decimal Form
