Power Supply Unit(PSU):
2 Types of Power:Direct Current(DC) Flows in one Direction Vs Alternating Current(AC) Flows in both directions
Computers use DC voltage, power comes out of wall as AC, PSU converts it
Voltage is the amount of 'power pressure' being transmitted
Ensure that you are always plugging your hardware into the correct voltage outlets or it could damage/destroy the machine
Amperage(AMPs) refers to the amount of electricity pulled out
Amps pull, voltages push electricity
Wattage=amount of volts and amps a device needs
Err on the side of large Power supplys if not sure which is needed

Mobile Devices:
Are computers too, have CPUs, RAM, storage, power systems, and peripherals.. albeit smaller

Batteries and Charging systems:
May have external charger, external batteries, cradle, or stand or wireless charger
Rechargable Batteries have a limited life system dictated by it's charge cycle
Charge Cycle=One full charge and discharge of battery
At end of lifespan might take longer to charge, and hold less charge
Rechargable batteries can be damaged in very hot or very cold temperatures
  Using a battery outside of it's safe operating range can cause batteries to swell, rupture, or catch fire
Some devices slow themselves down as battery life is getting long-if a device is running slow, sometimes check the battery

Peripherals:

search 'MSTSC' in start menu run box or 'Remote Desktop Connections' in Start menu
Requires: login account name/host name or IP address
Use a password or SSH authentication key public(locks) vs private(unlocks)
After making a connection you can launch a GUI(Graphical user interface) to use server computer on something other than command line
Virtual Private Network(VPN): Allows you to connect to a private network, over the internet
command line: 
putty.exe -ssh sean@104.131.122.215 22 

Operating System=The whole package that manages our computer's resources and lets us interact with it
2 main parts of OS:
  Kernel Space=Process manager/Memory Manager/File Manager/ I/O Manager
  User Space=Applications
Mac vs Windows vs Linux
Linux Distributions=Ubuntu/Debian/Redhat

Files:
Kernel Handles Files in 3 ways=File Data/MetaData/File System
NTFS-File Handling System used in Microsoft
HFS/APFS-File Handling System used in MacOS
ext4-File Handling System for Linux
File Handling Systems do not interact well with eachother
File Data is stored onto harddrives as data blocks
Block Storage=Improves faster handling of data because the data isn't stored as one long piece and can be accesssed quicker
MEtadata=Who created it/when created/File owner/Permissions/File Size/Date Modified/File type
File Extension=Appended part of a filename that tells us what type of file it is in certain operating systems

Process Management:
Process=A program that is executing
Each open tab in chrome is a new process
Each process requires limited hardware like RAM
Time slice=A very short interval of time that gets allocated to a process for CPU execution
Kernel creates processses, efficiently schedules them, and manages how processes are terminated

Memory Management:
Virtual Memory=Combination of hard drive space and RAM that acts like memory that our processes can use
Allocated space on hard Drive=Swap Space

I/O Management:
All I/O peripherals are managed by the kernel

Interacting with OS/User Space:
2 ways to interact with OS: A shell(Cmd line/text commands) or GUI(Graphical user Interface)
Shell=A program that interprets text commands and sends them to the OS to execute
Power user=Above average users(should know how to use a shell/command lines)
BASH(Bourne Again Shell)=Linux Shell

Logs:
Logs=Files that record system events on our computer, just like a systems diary

The Boot Process:
Follows a general pattern
Powered on -> BIOS/UEFI -> POST(Power on self test) -> Boot Device selected -> Boot Loader -> OS -> Kernels+drivers ->Essential system processes
BIOS/UEFI=Low level software that initializes our computers hardware to makesure everything is good to go

Installing OS's:
Virtual Machine(Virtual Machine)-just a copy of a real machine-Use software specific to one OS

Installing Windows:
  Hit F12(possibly other key) while booting to enter BIOS settings
  Boot from USB with OS on it
  Select drive you want to install it on
  Update(multiple times)
  Reboot
  Create first User(Username/PW)
  Update System Settings

Installing Linux(Ubuntu, most popular):
  Create a bootable USB drive with Opensource Ubuntu OS
  Boot from USB device
  Pick Default Settings
  Create First Account(Name/Username/PW/Hostname=name used to talk to other computers)
  Change System Settings

Mac OS X:
  Comes Preinstalled on Apple
  2 finger click=right click for more info

Chrome OS:
Unlike other OS's, Chrome OS has one main purpose: to be a secure and simple way for the user to interact with the web(Web Browser Based OS)
Can Run android and linux applications in containers
ChromeOS Machines are interchangable because most data is stored in the cloud, not locally


============================================Week 4:
The Internet(Created by Al Gore):
You can create a network of just 2 computers, Internet is just a network of billions of computers
The Internet=The Physical Connection of computers and wires around the world(and satellites)
The Web=The information on the internet
Networking=Managing, Building, Designing Networks
Servers connect directly to the internet and Store the websites for the internet
Clients(Machines/Phones/Video Game Consoles) request the content from the servers
Clients don't connect directly to the internet-They Connect to an ISP(Internet Service Provider) connected to the internet and other ISP's
Computers on a network have an identifier called an IP address
Computers that connect to a network also have a MAC address-generally hard coded to each device
When you send and receive data through a network you need to have both an IP address and a MAC address
Data sent through a network is sent through packets(little bits of data)

Networking Hardware:
Ethernet Cable-Physical Network Connection
WIFI(Wireless Networking)-
Fibre Optics-Most Expensive Method-Sends data through glass fibres/light instead of wires
Router=Connects lots of different devices together and helps route network traffic
Switches/Hubs similar to routers
Network Stack=A set of hardware or software that provides the infrastructure for a computer network
When diagnosing network errors, work your way up the network stack or potential points of failures, End user computer -> Cables -> switches

Network Protocols:
Network Protocols=A set of rules for how we transfer data in a network
Transmission Control Protocol(TCP): Protocol that handles reliable delivery from one network to another
Internet Protocol(IP): Responsible for delivering packets to right computers

The Web:
All web pages can be accessed through the web
HTML(Hyper Text Markup Language):Coding language used by web browsers
URL(Uniform Resource Locater):Domain Name
WWW.(World wide web):
ICANN:Domain name Register-unique identifier for URL
DNS(Domain Name System):Internet Directory, uses human readable words to map to IP addresses. 172.217.6.46=Google Home Page
