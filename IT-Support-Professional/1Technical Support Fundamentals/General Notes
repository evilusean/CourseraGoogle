============================================Week 1:
Introduction to IT:
Information Technology(IT)=The use of digital technology, like computers and the internet, to store and process data into useful information
What does IT do?
Managing, Installing, Maintaining, Troubleshooting, Configuring computing equipment
Abacus-Invented 500bc earliest computers
Mechanical Calculator-17th century Blaise Pascal (gears+lever to perform addition subtraction multiplication and division)
Loom textile industry design patterns=programmable loom=1800's Joseph Jacquard=Jacquard Machine=Punch Cards
Charles Babbage=Difference Engine 1820's vs Analytical Engine+punch cards(+Ada Lovelace)First general purpose computing machine
Algorithim=A series of steps that solve specific problems

Encryption:
Cryptography=The art of writing and solving codes
Alan Turing=Enigma Machine Decrypted
Data was stored on punch cards until Magnetic Tape(Vinyl Records/Cassettes)
Admiral Gracehopper, Harvard="Bug in the system" Moth in a vacuum tube(Sept 9, 1947)
Admiral Gracehopper created first compiler(human language -> machine code)
Vacuum Tubes vs Transistors -> Hard disk drives/Microprocessors
Xerox Alto(1973)=First Computer with GUI+Mouse+Keyboard that resembled our PC's

IBM 1981=MSDOS(Microsoft Disk Operating System)
Bill Gates=Windows(1985), Windows 95 for Household PC's
Atari Pong 1972=First 'Video Game' Vs Arcades
Atari Video Computer System=First Household videogame console
Richard Stallmen=First Free OS(GNU) Open Source
Ken Thompson/Dennis Richey=Unix
Linus Torvald=Linux
PDA's(Personal Digital Assistant)=First 'pocketable' computer(Nokia 90's)

Light bulb example 0=off, 1=on
A bit is a binary digit-0 or 1
A byte is 8 bits, 2 to the 8th power-256 possible outcomes
8 bits per character

Character Encoding=Assigns binary values to characters, so that we can read them as mere humans
ASCII=127 Values originally
UTF-8
RGB=colors
Logic Gates=Allow our transistors to do more complex tasks, like decide where to send electrical signals depending on logical conditions

Binary form Addition=128 + 64 + 32 + 16 + 8 + 4 + 1=Adds up to character through addition if switch is on
Vs Decimal Form

============================================Week 2:
HardWare:
Ports=Connection points that we can connect devices to that extend the functionality of our computer
Central Processing Unit(CPU)=the 'brain' of the computer, does all the calculations and data processing
Random Access Memory(RAM)=Short term memory
Hard Drive=holds all data
Motherboard=Holds and connects all computer components in place, circulatory system of the computer
Power Supply Unit(PSU)=Converts power from wall outlet into usable type by computer
External Data Bus(EDB)=Row of wires that interconnect wires of computer when voltage is on state is 1, no voltage is 0, veins of PC
Register=Inside CPU, allows it to store data
Memory Controller Chip(MCC)=Bridge between CPU and RAM, brain nerves of PC
Address Bus=Connects CPU to MCC, sends location of data to CPU, then sends data through EDB
Cache=Smaller than ram, stores data, faster than RAM, used to store frequently used data
  3 types of caches=L1 L2 L3 (L1 is smallest, fastest cache)

CPU:
Clock Wire=CPU internal clock, keeps operations in sync, one clock cycle is a set of instructions
Clock Speed= Maximum amount of clock cycles that can happen in a certain time period(3.4GHz(gigahertz)=3.4 billion cycles per second)
Overclocking increases rate of CPU
Intel Vs AMD Vs Qualcomm=CPU manufacturers
Check CPU Compatibility with motherboard before installing
CPU sockets=Land Grid Array(LGA) Vs Pin Grid Array(PGA)
Requires a heat sink(fan)
32 bit vs 64 bit architecture on CPU= How much data they can efficiently handle
https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/15056/windows-7-32-64-bit-faq
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/64-bit_computing#32-bit_vs_64-bit%E2%80%A6

Ram:
PC's Short term memory
Memory is volatile(once you power off machine, data is cleared)
DRAM=Dynamic Random Access Memory=1 or 0 stored in microscopic capactors on RAM
DIMM=Dual Inline Memory Module=have different size pins on them
SDRAM=Synchronous DRAM=Synchronized to systems clock speed, allows quicker processing
DDR SDRM=Double Data Rate SDRAM=DDR1 Vs DDR2 Vs DDR3 Vs DDR4(DDR4 currently fastest type short term memory for PC)
Before buying RAM ensure it is compatible with the motherboard

Motherboard:
The computers foundation
Chipset=Determines how components 'talk' to each other on our machine
2 chips:
  North Bridge=Interconnects RAM, Videocards, and CPU
  South Bridge=Interconnects I/O controllers, harddrives, USB devices, peripherals(mouse, keyboard, monitor)
  Some motherboards have NorthBridge integrated with CPU
Expansion slots=Give the ability to increase the functionality of the computer
PCI Express(Peripheral Component Interconnect Express): allows for expansion
Form Factor=Determines the amount of 'stuff' you can fit on motherboard
ATX=Advanced Technology eXtended=most common PC
ITX=Information Technology eXtended=Smaller form factor

Storage:
1 bit = 0 or 1
Byte = 8 bits
KB(kilobyte) = 1024 bytes
MB(Megabyte) = 1024 KB
GB(Gigabyte) = 1024 MB
TB(Terabyte) = 1024 GB
Hard drive failure happens frequently, use backups
Hard Disk Drives(HDDs)=uses a spinning platter and mechanical arm to read and write data (RPM=revolution per minute, higher=faster)
Hard Disk Drives are cheaper but more prone to failure, more moving parts
Solid State Drives(SSDs)=no moving parts, data stored on microchips, more expensive, less risk
ATA interfaces used to connect hard drives to motherboard
SATA most common drive interface, uses cables
NVMExpress(NVME)=faster interface, uses expansion slot, no cables

Power Supply Unit(PSU):
2 Types of Power:Direct Current(DC) Flows in one Direction Vs Alternating Current(AC) Flows in both directions
Computers use DC voltage, power comes out of wall as AC, PSU converts it
Voltage is the amount of 'power pressure' being transmitted
Ensure that you are always plugging your hardware into the correct voltage outlets or it could damage/destroy the machine
Amperage(AMPs) refers to the amount of electricity pulled out
Amps pull, voltages push electricity
Wattage=amount of volts and amps a device needs
Err on the side of large Power supplys if not sure which is needed

Mobile Devices:
Are computers too, have CPUs, RAM, storage, power systems, and peripherals.. albeit smaller
Generally integrated(sautered together)
System on a Chip(SoC): Packs the CPU, RAM and sometimes even the storage on a single chip
Connector types: USB-C, Lightning adaptor, Mini USB, Micro USB, Micro HDMI, Mini HDMI, Mini Displayport
Helping Users: Set up, Troubleshooting, Repair, Replacement

Batteries and Charging systems:
May have external charger, external batteries, cradle, or stand or wireless charger
Rechargable Batteries have a limited life system dictated by it's charge cycle
Charge Cycle=One full charge and discharge of battery
At end of lifespan might take longer to charge, and hold less charge
Rechargable batteries can be damaged in very hot or very cold temperatures
  Using a battery outside of it's safe operating range can cause batteries to swell, rupture, or catch fire
Some devices slow themselves down as battery life is getting long-if a device is running slow, sometimes check the battery

Peripherals:
Mouse/Keyboard/Monitor
Anything that you connect to your computer externally that adds functionality
USB(Universal Serial Bus) Transfer Speeds
USB 2.0 = 480 Mb/s
USB 3.0 = 5Gb / s
USB 3.1 = 10Gb /s 
MB = MegaByte = A unit of data storage
Mb = Megabit = A unit of data transfer rate
1 byte = 8 bits
USB 2.0 are black outlets, USB 3.0 are blue, USB 3.1 are teal
Monitors:
DVI = just do video
HDMI = Audio and video
Displayport = Audio and Video
