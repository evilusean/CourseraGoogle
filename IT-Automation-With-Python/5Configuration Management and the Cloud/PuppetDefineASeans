Scale:
Have larger impacts with the same amount of effort
Unmanaged:
Manually deploying a server, more servers=more time
Configuration Management Systems:
Configuration management is a systems engineering process for establishing and maintaining consistency of a product's(or fleet) performance
Infrastructure as code(IAC):
When all the configuration necessary to deploy and manage a node in the infrastructure is stored in version control
deployed using automatic tools for the configuration

In puppet the client connects to server and uploads a list of facts to the server, the server then updates itself according to the list of rules
Client=Puppet Agent 
Server=Puppet Master

Resources=The basic unit for modeling the configuration that we want to manage(service, package, file)
Puppet Syntax=Variables, Conditional Statements, Functions
Facts=Variables that represent the charasteristics of the system using Factor(OS/Memory/VM/IP/etc)

idempotent=An action can be performed over and over again without changing the system after the first time the action was performed with
no unintented side effects

test and repair paradigm=actions are taken only if necessary to acheive a goal

stateless=no state being kept inbetween runs of puppet
