Scale:
Have larger impacts with the same amount of effort
Unmanaged:
Manually deploying a server, more servers=more time
Configuration Management Systems:
Configuration management is a systems engineering process for establishing and maintaining consistency of a product's(or fleet) performance
Infrastructure as code(IAC):
When all the configuration necessary to deploy and manage a node in the infrastructure is stored in version control
deployed using automatic tools for the configuration

In puppet the client connects to server and uploads a list of facts to the server, the server then updates itself according to the list of rules
Client=Puppet Agent 
Server=Puppet Master
puppet is consistent, versionable, reliable, repeatable

Resources=The basic unit for modeling the configuration that we want to manage(service, package, file)
Puppet Syntax=Variables, Conditional Statements, Functions
Facts=Variables that represent the charasteristics of the system using Factor(OS/Memory/VM/IP/etc)
manifest=a puppet file with .pp extension
catalog=the list of rules that are generated for one specific computer once the server has evaluated all variables, conditionals, and functions
module=collection of manifests and associated data(contains manfiests, files, templates)
Node=any system where we can run a puppet agent

Fully qualified domain name=sometimes also referred to as an absolute domain name, is a domain name that specifies its exact location in the tree
hierarchy of the Domain Name System (DNS).
Public Key Inrastructure(PKI):used by puppet to form connections between server and clients
Secure Sockets Layer(SSL): used by Puppet/HTTPS as a PKI for verification of identity, encrypted
Certificate Authority(CA): Verifies public and private keys for verification

production= the parts of the infrastructure where a service is executed and served to its users
always test before putting on production machines

idempotent=An action can be performed over and over again without changing the system after the first time the action was performed with
no unintented side effects

test and repair paradigm=actions are taken only if necessary to acheive a goal

stateless=no state being kept inbetween runs of puppet
