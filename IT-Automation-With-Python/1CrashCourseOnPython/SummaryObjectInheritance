Object Inheritance
In object-oriented programming, the concept of inheritance allows you to build relationships between objects, grouping together similar concepts and reducing code
duplication. Let's create a custom Fruit class with color and flavor attributes:

>>> class Fruit:
...     def __init__(self, color, flavor):
...         self.color = color
...         self.flavor = flavor
...

We defined a Fruit class with a constructor for color and flavor attributes. Next, we'll define an Apple class along with a new Grape class, 
both of which we want to inherit properties and behaviors from the Fruit class:

>>> class Apple(Fruit):
...     pass
... 
>>> class Grape(Fruit):
...     pass
... 

In Python, we use parentheses in the class declaration to have the class inherit from the Fruit class. So in this example, we’re instructing our computer 
that both the Apple class and Grape class inherit from the Fruit class. This means that they both have the same constructor method which sets the color and 
flavor attributes. We can now create instances of our Apple and Grape classes:

>>> granny_smith = Apple("green", "tart")
>>> carnelian = Grape("purple", "sweet")
>>> print(granny_smith.flavor)
tart
>>> print(carnelian.color)
purple

Inheritance allows us to define attributes or methods that are shared by all types of fruit without having to define them in each fruit class individually.
We can then also define specific attributes or methods that are only relevant for a specific type of fruit. Let's look at another example, this time with animals:

>>> class Animal:
...     sound = ""
...     def __init__(self, name):
...         self.name = name
...     def speak(self):
...         print("{sound} I'm {name}! {sound}".format(
...             name=self.name, sound=self.sound))
... 
>>> class Piglet(Animal):
...     sound = "Oink!"
... 
>>> class Cow(Animal):
...     sound = "Moooo"
...

We defined a parent class, Animal, with two animal types inheriting from that class: Piglet and Cow. The parent Animal class has an attribute to store the sound
the animal makes, and the constructor class takes the name that will be assigned to the instance when it's created. There is also the speak method, which will print
the name of the animal along with the sound it makes. We defined the Piglet and Cow classes, which inherit from the Animal class, and we set the sound attributes for
each animal type. Now, we can create instances of our Piglet and Cow classes and have them speak:

>>> hamlet = Piglet("Hamlet")
>>> hamlet.speak()
Oink! I'm Hamlet! Oink!
... 
>>> class Cow(Animal):
...     sound = "Moooo"
... 
>>> milky = Cow("Milky White")
>>> milky.speak()
Moooo I'm Milky White! Moooo

We create instances of both the Piglet and Cow class, and set the names for our instances. Then we call the speak method of each instance, which results in the
formatted string being printed; it includes the sound the animal type makes, along with the instance name we assigned.

Object Composition
You can have a situation where two different classes are related, but there is no inheritance going on. This is referred to as composition -- where one 
class makes use of code contained in another class. For example, imagine we have a Package class which represents a software package. It contains attributes about the
software package, like name, version, and size. We also have a Repository class which represents all the packages available for installation. While there’s 
no inheritance relationship between the two classes, they are related. The Repository class will contain a dictionary or list of Packages that are contained in the
repository. Let's take a look at an example Repository class definition:

>>> class Repository:
...      def __init__(self):
...          self.packages = {}
...      def add_package(self, package):
...          self.packages[package.name] = package
...      def total_size(self):
...          result = 0
...          for package in self.packages.values():
...              result += package.size
...          return result

In the constructor method, we initialize the packages dictionary, which will contain the package objects available in this repository instance. 
We initialize the dictionary in the constructor to ensure that every instance of the Repository class has its own dictionary.

We then define the add_package method, which takes a Package object as a parameter, and then adds it to our dictionary, using the package name attribute as the key.

Finally, we define a total_size method which computes the total size of all packages contained in our repository. This method iterates through the values in our
repository dictionary and adds together the size attributes from each package object contained in the dictionary, returning the total at the end. In this example, 
we’re making use of Package attributes within our Repository class. We’re also calling the values() method on our packages dictionary instance. Composition allows us to use objects as attributes, as well as access all their attributes and methods.
